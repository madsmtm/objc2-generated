/// structure is used to determine the format of the remainder of
/// the kernel event. This structure will appear on all messages
/// received on a kernel event socket. To post a kernel event, a
/// slightly different structure is used.
/// Field: total_size Total size of the kernel event message including the
/// header.
/// Field: vendor_code The vendor code indicates which vendor generated the
/// kernel event. This gives every vendor a unique set of classes
/// and subclasses to use. Use the SIOCGKEVVENDOR ioctl to look up
/// vendor codes for vendors other than Apple. Apple uses
/// KEV_VENDOR_APPLE.
/// Field: kev_class The class of the kernel event.
/// Field: kev_subclass The subclass of the kernel event.
/// Field: id Monotonically increasing value.
/// Field: event_code The event code.
/// Field: event_data Any additional data about this event. Format will
/// depend on the vendor_code, kev_class, kev_subclass, and
/// event_code. The length of the event_data can be determined
/// using total_size - KEV_MSG_HEADER_SIZE.
