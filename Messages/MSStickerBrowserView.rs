The browser provides drag-and-drop functionality. The user can press and hold a sticker to peel it from the browser, then drag the sticker to any balloon in the transcript. The user can also tap stickers to add them to the Messages app’s input field.

The data source can dynamically change the list of stickers at runtime. You can also customize the size of the stickers inside the browser.
    ///
    /// If you create an [`MSStickerBrowserViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/messages/msstickerbrowserviewcontroller) object, it automatically creates and displays a sticker browser view with stickers of the specified size. The controller is automatically set as the browser’s data source. Alternatively, you can instantiate your own sticker browser view, letting you customize the size of both the browser and the stickers; however, you need to provide your own data source.
