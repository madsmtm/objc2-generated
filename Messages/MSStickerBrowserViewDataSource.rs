    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// To load its stickers, the [`MSStickerBrowserView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/messages/msstickerbrowserview) class performs the following steps:
    ///
    /// 1. The browser calls the data source’s [`numberOfStickersInStickerBrowserView:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/messages/msstickerbrowserviewdatasource/numberofstickers(in:)) method to get the number of stickers.
    ///
    /// 2. The browser repeatedly calls the data source’s [`stickerBrowserView:stickerAtIndex:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/messages/msstickerbrowserviewdatasource/stickerbrowserview(_:stickerat:)) method to load the individual stickers. Initially, the browser requests only enough stickers to fill the screen. The browser requests additional stickers as the user scrolls and new stickers become visible.
    ///
    /// Both methods are required. If the sticker collection changes at runtime, call the [`MSStickerBrowserView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/messages/msstickerbrowserview) class’s [`reloadData`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/messages/msstickerbrowserview/reloaddata()) method to reload the stickers.
