    /// An object that plays audio from a 3D location and orientation in a scene.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// This class represents a sound-emitting point or area in a virtual environment, positioned and oriented by a 3D [`transform`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/phaseobject/transform).
    ///
    /// A spatial mixer, [`PHASESpatialMixerDefinition`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/phasespatialmixerdefinition), adds environmental effects to sound sources. To tie a mixer to a sound source, create a [`PHASEMixerParameters`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/phasemixerparameters) object and pass it into the `mixerParameters` argument of a sound event’s [`initWithEngine:assetIdentifier:mixerParameters:error:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/phasesoundevent/init(engine:assetidentifier:mixerparameters:)) initializer.
    ///
    /// For an example that demonstrates sound sources, see [Playing sound from a location in a 3D scene](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/playing-sound-from-a-location-in-a-3d-scene).
