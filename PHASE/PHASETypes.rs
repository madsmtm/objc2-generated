///
/// ## Overview
///
/// To define the manner in which PHASE processes commands and updates internal state, select an option from this enumeration and pass it to the `updateMode` parameter of the [`PHASEEngine`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/phaseengine) initializer, [`initWithUpdateMode:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/phaseengine/init(updatemode:)).
///
///
/// Update mode for the engine.
///
/// The engine update mode determines the rate at which the engine consumes client commands, performs internal updates, and calls any registered handlers.
/// All API calls to the engine are queued until the engine updates.
/// The engine update mode determines if the engine or the application triggers the consumption of API commands.
///
/// Note: The update mode does not affect the Audio IO Thread or rendering, in general. The Audio IO Thread always runs in the background, independent of the update mode.
///
/// The engine will internally consume client commands at a rate opaque to the client.
/// In general, automatic update mode is meant for simpler applications that just want to play sounds, without having to maintain a strict update loop.
/// Due to the fact that the engine consumes client commands at its own internal rate, the client is never guaranteed that two independent commands will synchronize.
///
/// When an application requires precise synchronization of API calls with the main update, manual mode is the best choice.
/// In this mode, clients will need to call [PHASEEngine update] periodically to process new commands, perform internal updates, and receive callbacks.
/// The rate at which the client calls update should at least match the rate at which other time-critical subsystems are updated, such graphics rendering etc.
/// API calls between calls to [PHASEEngine update] are guaranteed to be synchronized.
/// For example, the client can move two sources into place, request to start two sound events (one per source), then call [PHASEEngine update].
/// These calls will be guaranteed to be processed at the same time.

/// PHASE applies curves in several places across the framework:
///
/// - A [`PHASEEnvelopeSegment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/phaseenvelopesegment) object represents one curved portion of an envelope’s graph.
///
/// - The [`PHASEGroup`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/phasegroup) class applies a curve type to its sounds by fading its volume with the [`fadeGain:duration:curveType:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/phasegroup/fadegain(gain:duration:curvetype:)) function, and to its rate, with [`fadeRate:duration:curveType:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/phasegroup/faderate(rate:duration:curvetype:)).
///
/// - Each [`PHASEGroupPresetSetting`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/phasegrouppresetsetting) applies a curve to control a setting’s rate of change.
///
/// ### Apply a Curve as a Rate of Change
///
/// In most cases, PHASE applies curves to output a rate of change. For example, an  envelope segment’s [`curveType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/phaseenvelopesegment/curvetype) determines where along the segment’s domain the y-value changes more quickly. The following figure compares all the curves’ rate of change by plotting their input over the range `(0,0)` to `(1,1)`.
