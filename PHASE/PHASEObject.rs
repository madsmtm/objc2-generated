    /// An object in the scene.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// This class models a member of your app’s scene by defining a 3D position and orientation.
    ///
    /// The following subclasses derive from this class:
    ///
    /// - [`PHASESource`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/phasesource): An object that plays audio from a 3D location and orientation in a scene.
    ///
    /// - [`PHASEListener`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/phaselistener): A central point of reference that defines the area within the scene that’s most audible to the user.
    ///
    /// - [`PHASEOccluder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/phaseoccluder): An object with a shape and position that blocks audio from reaching the listener.
    ///
    /// The [`children`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/phaseobject/children) array holds instances of this class to position and orient them relatively.
    ///
    ///
