    /// A class that represents the day of the week.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The `EKRecurrenceDayOfWeek` class represents a day of the week for use with an [`EKRecurrenceRule`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/eventkit/ekrecurrencerule) object.
    ///
    /// A day of the week can optionally have a week number, indicating a specific day in the recurrence rule’s frequency. For example, a day of the week with a day value of Tuesday and a week number of 2 would represent the second Tuesday of every month in a monthly recurrence rule, and the second Tuesday of every year in a yearly recurrence rule. A day of the week with a week number of 0 ignores its week number.
    ///
    ///
    /// Class which represents a day of the week this recurrence will occur.
    ///
    /// EKRecurrenceDayOfWeek specifies either a simple day of the week, or the nth instance
    /// of a particular day of the week, such as the third Tuesday of every month. The week
    /// number is only valid when used with monthly or yearly recurrences, since it would
    /// be otherwise meaningless.
    ///
    /// Valid values for dayOfTheWeek are integers 1-7, which correspond to days of the week
    /// with Sunday = 1. Valid values for weekNumber portion are (+/-)1-53, where a negative
    /// value indicates a value from the end of the range. For example, in a yearly event -1
    /// means last week of the year. -1 in a Monthly recurrence indicates the last week of
    /// the month.
    ///
    /// The value 0 also indicates the weekNumber is irrelevant (every Sunday, etc.).
    ///
    /// Day-of-week weekNumber values that are out of bounds for the recurrence type will
    /// result in an exception when trying to initialize the recurrence. In particular,
    /// weekNumber must be zero when passing EKRecurrenceDayOfWeek objects to initialize a weekly
    /// recurrence.
