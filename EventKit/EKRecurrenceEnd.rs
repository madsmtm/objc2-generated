    /// A class that defines the end of a recurrence rule.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The `EKRecurrenceEnd` class defines the end of a recurrence rule defined by an [`EKRecurrenceRule`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/eventkit/ekrecurrencerule) object. The recurrence end can be specified by a date (date-based) or by a maximum count of occurrences (count-based). An event that is intended to continue indefinitely should have its `EKRecurrenceEnd` set to `nil`.
    ///
    ///
    /// Class which represents when a recurrence should end.
    ///
    /// EKRecurrenceEnd is an attribute of EKRecurrenceRule that defines how long
    /// the recurrence is scheduled to repeat. The recurrence can be defined either
    /// with an NSUInteger that indicates the total number times it repeats, or with
    /// an NSDate, after which it no longer repeats. An event which is set to never
    /// end should have its EKRecurrenceEnd set to nil.
    ///
    /// If the end of the pattern is defines with an NSDate, the client must pass a
    /// valid NSDate, nil cannot be passed. If the end of the pattern is defined as
    /// terms of a number of occurrences, the occurrenceCount passed to the initializer
    /// must be positive, it cannot be 0. If the client attempts to initialize a
    /// EKRecurrenceEnd with a nil NSDate or OccurrenceCount of 0, an exception is raised.
    ///
    /// A EKRecurrenceEnd initialized with an end date will return 0 for occurrenceCount.
    /// One initialized with a number of occurrences will return nil for its endDate.
