    /// A class that creates a new frame processor for the configured video effect.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Use this class to perform frame by frame processing on your video. Start by specifying a video effect by passing a [`VTFrameProcessorConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/videotoolbox/vtframeprocessorconfiguration) object to the [`startSessionWithConfiguration:error:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/videotoolbox/vtframeprocessor/startsession(configuration:)) call. Once the session is created, [`processWithParameters:completionHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/videotoolbox/vtframeprocessor/process(parameters:completionhandler:)) is called in a loop to process your video’s frames one at a time. Once all the frames are processed, call an [`endSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/videotoolbox/vtframeprocessor/endsession()) to finish all pending processing.
    ///
    /// For successful processing, the caller needs to ensure that all buffers passed to the processWithParameters interface are unmodified (including attachments) until the function returns or the callback is received in the case of asynchronous mode.
    ///
    ///
    /// Provides a unified interface you can use to apply video effects to frames.
    ///
    /// The VTFrameProcessor gives access to a set of powerful video processing implementation suitable for different use cases.
    /// A configuration object (conforming to the ``VTFrameProcessorConfiguration`` protocol) passes initialization and
    /// configuration parameters for the processor. A Parameter object (conforming to the ``VTFrameProcessorParameters``
    /// protocol) provides the parameters for each individual processing operation. A Configuration object and a Parameter
    /// object define each processor implementation. These Configuration and Parameters objects for each implementation are
    /// defined in a processor-specific header file.
    ///
    /// Use an instance of this class to apply configured video effects either directly to pixel buffers or as a
    /// part of Metal pipeline. The video effect must be specified as a ``VTFrameProcessorConfiguration`` instance at session
    /// startup. Once a session is started, you need to call one of the process methods for each input frame. After all input
    /// frames have been provided, session must be ended for the system to finish all pending processing.
    ///
    /// After you call the process function, you must not modify input and output buffers (including attachments) before the
    /// function returns or the system receives the callback, in the case of asynchronous processing.
