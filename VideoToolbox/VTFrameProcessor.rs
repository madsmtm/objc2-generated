    /// The VTFrameProcessor class is the main class to perform frame processing. Users can specify a video effect by passing a VTFrameProcessorConfiguration based object to the startSessionWithConfiguration call. Once a session is created, the processWithParameters method is called in a loop to process the frames one by one. Once all the frames are processed, endSession needs to called to finish all pending processing.  The caller needs to ensure that all buffers passed to the processWithParameters interface are unmodified (inclduing attachments) until the function returns or the callback is received in the case of asynchronous mode.
