    /// Before opening a stream, you can copy the object from this property and configure it using the Secure Transport API. You can also set this property to specify a new `SSLContextRef` for a stream. The behavior depends on whether the stream has been opened and on whether an SSL context is associated with the stream, as follows:
    ///
    /// - If the stream has not been opened, the specified object replaces any existing context, and is used in the initial stream handshake when the connection is opened.
    ///
    /// - If the stream has been opened without SSL enabled, setting this property initiates an SSL handshake over the existing socket.
    ///
    /// - After the initial SSL handshake occurs, changing the context object is unsupported.
    ///
    /// If an SSL settings dictionary is set for the  `kCFStreamPropertySSLSettings` key, an `SSLContextRef` object is created internally and configured based on that dictionary.  However, if an `SSLContextRef` object is set afterwards, its configuration takes precedence over the previously configured context.
