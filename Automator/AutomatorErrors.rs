/// Automator error codes.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// These constants are [`NSError`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nserror) code numbers in the Automator error domain ([`AMAutomatorErrorDomain`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/automator/amautomatorerrordomain)). You’ll obtain these error codes from the instances of [`NSError`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nserror) returned, for example, by certain methods of [`AMWorkflow`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/automator/amworkflow) and [`AMWorkflowController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/automator/amworkflowcontroller). For related information, see [`AMActionErrorKey`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/automator/amactionerrorkey).
