    /// Parameters:
    /// - context: The graphics context you want to create the layer relative to. The layer uses this graphics context as a reference for initialization.
    ///
    /// - size: The size, in default user space units, of the layer relative to the graphics context.

    /// - auxiliaryInfo: Reserved for future use. Pass `NULL`.

    /// ## Return Value

    /// A CGLayer object. In Objective-C, you’re responsible for releasing this object using the function [`CGLayerRelease`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cglayerrelease) when you no longer need the layer.

    /// ## Discussion
    ///
    /// After you create a [`CGLayerRef`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cglayer) object, you should reuse it whenever you can to facilitate the Core Graphics caching strategy. Core Graphics caches any objects that are reused, including [`CGLayerRef`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cglayer) objects. Objects that are reused frequently remain in the cache. In contrast, objects that are used once in a while may be moved in and out of the cache according to their frequency of use. If you don’t reuse [`CGLayerRef`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cglayer) objects, Core Graphics won’t cache them. This means that you lose an opportunity to improve the performance of your application.
