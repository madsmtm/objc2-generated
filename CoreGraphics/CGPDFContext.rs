/// Creates a PDF graphics context.

/// Parameters:
/// - consumer: The data consumer to receive the PDF output data.
///
/// - mediaBox: A pointer to a rectangle that defines the size and location of the PDF page, or `NULL`. The origin of the rectangle should typically be `(0,0)`. Core Graphics uses this rectangle as the default bounds of the page’s media box. If you pass `NULL`, Core Graphics uses a default page size of 8.5 by 11 inches (612 by 792 points).
///
/// - auxiliaryInfo: A dictionary that specifies any additional information to be used by the PDF context when generating the PDF file, or `NULL`. The dictionary is retained by the new context, so on return you may safely release it.
