    /// These range from dedicated storage devices like hard drives and flash storage to network connections, and beyond.
    /// Subclasses define behavior specific to a given kind of resource, such as ``FSBlockDeviceResource-c.class`` for disk partition (IOMedia) file systems.
    /// These file systems are typical disk file systems such as HFS, APFS, ExFAT, ext2fs, or NTFS.
