/// ## Discussion
///
/// The appearance of system-supplied images can change between releases. If you use an image for its intended purpose (and not because of how it looks), your code should look correct from release to release.
///
/// The size and aspect ratio of system images can also change between releases. In some situations, you should explicitly resize images as appropriate for your use. If you use these images in conjunction with an [`NSButtonCell`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsbuttoncell) object, however, you can use the [`imageScaling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsbuttoncell/imagescaling) property of the cell to control scaling instead. Similarly, for an [`NSSegmentedCell`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssegmentedcell) object, you can use the [`setImageScaling:forSegment:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssegmentedcell/setimagescaling(_:forsegment:)): method to control scaling.

extern_class!(
    /// A high-level interface for manipulating image data.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// You use instances of [`NSImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimage) to load existing images, create new images, and draw the resulting image data into your views. Although you use this class predominantly for image-related operations, the class itself knows little about the underlying image data. Instead, it works in conjunction with one or more image representation objects (subclasses of [`NSImageRep`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimagerep)) to manage and render the image data. For the most part, these interactions are transparent.
    ///
    /// The  class serves many purposes, providing support for the following tasks:
    ///
    /// - Loading images stored on disk or at a specified URL.
    ///
    /// - Drawing images into a view or graphics context.
    ///
    /// - Providing the contents of a [`CALayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer) object.
    ///
    /// - Creating new images based on a series of captured drawing commands.
    ///
    /// - Producing versions of the image in a different format.
    ///
    /// The `NSImage` class itself is capable of managing image data in a variety of formats. The specific list of formats is dependent on the version of the operating system but includes many standard formats such as TIFF, JPEG, GIF, PNG, and PDF among others. AppKit manages each format using a specific type of image representation object, whose job is to manage the actual image data. You can get a list of supported formats using the methods described in Determining Supported Types of Images.
    ///
    /// For more information about how to use image objects in your app, see [Cocoa Drawing Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaDrawingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003290).
    ///
    /// ### Using Images with Core Animation Layers
    ///
    /// Although you can assign an `NSImage` object directly to the [`contents`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer/contents) property of a [`CALayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer) object, doing so may not always yield the best results. Instead of using your image object, you can use the [`layerContentsForContentsScale:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimage/layercontents(forcontentsscale:)) method to obtain an object that you can use for your layer’s contents. The image created by that method serves as the contents of a layer, which also supports all of the layer’s gravity modes. By contrast, the `NSImage` class supports only the [`kCAGravityResize`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayercontentsgravity/resize), [`kCAGravityResizeAspect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayercontentsgravity/resizeaspect), and [`kCAGravityResizeAspectFill`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayercontentsgravity/resizeaspectfill) modes.
    ///
    /// Before calling the [`layerContentsForContentsScale:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimage/layercontents(forcontentsscale:)) method, use the [`recommendedLayerContentsScale:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimage/recommendedlayercontentsscale(_:)) method to get the recommended scale factor for the resulting image. The code listing below shows a typical example that uses the scale factor of a window’s backing store as the desired scale factor. From that scale factor, the code gets the scale factor for the specified image object and creates an object that you assign to the layer. You might use this code for images that fit the layer bounds precisely or for which you rely on the [`contentsGravity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer/contentsgravity) property of the layer to position or scale the image.
    ///
    /// Listing 1. Assigning an image to a layer
    ///
    /// ```objc
    /// static void updateLayerWithImageInWindow1(NSImage *image, CALayer *layer, NSWindow *window) {
    ///    CGFloat desiredScaleFactor = [window backingScaleFactor];
    ///    CGFloat actualScaleFactor = [image recommendedLayerContentsScale:desiredScaleFactor];
    ///  
    ///    id layerContents = [image layerContentsForContentsScale:actualScaleFactor];
    ///  
    ///    [layer setContents:layerContents];

If you use the [`configurationByApplyingConfiguration:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimage/symbolconfiguration-swift.class/applying(_:)) method on the object, the new image attributes replace any previous attributes you supplied. After creating a symbol configuration object, assign it to the [`symbolConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimageview/symbolconfiguration) property of the [`NSImageView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimageview) object you use to display the image. If you draw the image directly, use the [`imageWithSymbolConfiguration:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimage/withsymbolconfiguration(_:)) method to create a new image that contains the new attributes.
