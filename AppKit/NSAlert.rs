    ///
    /// The methods of the [`NSAlert`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert) class allow you to specify alert level, alert text, button titles, and a custom icon should you require it. The class also lets your alerts display a help button and provides ways for apps to offer help specific to an alert.
    ///
    /// To display an alert as a sheet, call the [`beginSheetModalForWindow:completionHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert/beginsheetmodal(for:completionhandler:)) method; to display one as an app-modal dialog, use the [`runModal`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert/runmodal()) method.
    ///
    /// By design, an [`NSAlert`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert) object is intended for a single alert—that is, an alert with a unique combination of title, buttons, and so on—that is displayed upon a particular condition. You should create an [`NSAlert`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert) object for each alert dialog, creating it only  when you need to display an alert, and release it when you are done. If you have a particular alert dialog that you need to show repeatedly, you can retain and reuse an instance of [`NSAlert`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert) for this dialog.
    ///
    /// After creating an alert using one of the alert creation methods, you can customize it further prior to displaying it by customizing its attributes. See [Instance Attributes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert#instance-attributes).
    ///
    /// Unless you must maintain compatibility with existing alert-processing code that uses the function-based API, you should allocate (`alloc`) and initialize (`init`) the alert object, and then set its attributes using the appropriate methods of the `NSAlert` class.
    ///
    /// ### Instance Attributes
    ///
    /// [`NSAlert`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert) objects have the following attributes:
    ///
    /// - Type An alert’s type helps convey the importance or gravity of its message to the user. Specified with the [`alertStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert/alertstyle) property.
    ///
    /// - Message text The main message of the alert. Specified with [`messageText`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert/messagetext).
    ///
    /// - Informative text Additional information about the alert. Specified with [`informativeText`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert/informativetext).
    ///
    /// - Icon An optional, custom icon to display in the alert, which is used instead of the default app icon. Specified with [`icon`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert/icon).
    ///
    /// - Help Alerts can let the user get help about them. Use [`helpAnchor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert/helpanchor) and [`showsHelp`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert/showshelp).
    ///
    /// - Response buttons By default an alert has one response button: the OK button. You can add more response buttons using the [`addButtonWithTitle:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert/addbutton(withtitle:)) method.
    ///
    /// - Suppression checkbox A suppression checkbox allows the user to suppress the display of a particular alert in subsequent occurrences of the event that triggers it. Use [`showsSuppressionButton`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert/showssuppressionbutton).
    ///
    /// - Accessory view An accessory view lets you add additional information to an alert; for example, a text field with contact information. Use [`accessoryView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert/accessoryview), [`layout`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert/layout()).
    ///
