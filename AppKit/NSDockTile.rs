    /// The visual representation of your app’s miniaturized windows and app icon as they appear in the Dock.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// You do not create Dock tile objects explicitly in your app. Instead, you retrieve the Dock tile for an existing window or for the app by calling that object’s [`dockTile`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/docktile) method. Also, you do not subclass the [`NSDockTile`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdocktile) class; instead, you use the methods of the class to make the following customizations:
    ///
    /// - Badge the tile with a custom string.
    ///
    /// - Remove or show the application icon badge.
    ///
    /// - Draw the tile content yourself.
    ///
    /// If you decide to draw the tile content yourself, you must provide a custom content view to handle the drawing.
    ///
    /// ### Application Dock Tiles
    ///
    /// An application Dock tile defaults to display the application’s [`applicationIconImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/applicationiconimage).
    ///
    /// The application Dock tile never shows a smaller application icon badge.
    ///
    /// Whether using the default or custom view, the application Dock tile may be badged with a short custom string.
    ///
    /// ### Window Dock Tiles
    ///
    /// A window Dock tile defaults to display a miniaturized version of the windows contents with a badge derived from the application Dock icon, including any customized application Dock icon. The default window Dock tile image may not be badged with a custom string.
    ///
    /// A window Dock tile can use a custom view to draw the Dock icon. If a custom view is used, no application badge will be added, but the text label will be overlaid on top of the icon.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Customizing an application’s Dock tile when the application itself is not running requires that you write a plug-in. The plug-in’s principal class must implement the [`NSDockTilePlugIn`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdocktileplugin) protocol.
    ///
    /// The name of the plugin is indicated by a `NSDockTilePlugIn` key in the application’s `Info.plist` file.
    ///
    /// The plugin is loaded in a system process at login time or when the application tile is added to the Dock.  When the plugin is loaded, the principal class’ implementation of [`setDockTile:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdocktileplugin/setdocktile(_:)) is invoked, passing an [`NSDockTile`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdocktile) for the plug-in to customize.  If the principal class implements [`dockMenu`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdocktileplugin/dockmenu()) it is invoked whenever the user causes the application’s dock menu to be shown.  When the dock tile is no longer valid (for example,. the application has been removed from the dock) -[`setDockTile:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdocktileplugin/setdocktile(_:)) is invoked with `nil`.
