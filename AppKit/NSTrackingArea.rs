/// The data type defined for the constants specified in the `options` parameter of [`initWithRect:options:owner:userInfo:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea/init(rect:options:owner:userinfo:)). These constants are described below; you can specify multiple constants by performing a bitwise-OR operation with them. In particular, you must supply one or more of the tracking-type constants (that is, [`NSTrackingMouseEnteredAndExited`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea/options-swift.struct/mouseenteredandexited), [`NSTrackingMouseMoved`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea/options-swift.struct/mousemoved), and [`NSTrackingCursorUpdate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea/options-swift.struct/cursorupdate)) and one of the active constants (that is, [`NSTrackingActiveWhenFirstResponder`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea/options-swift.struct/activewhenfirstresponder), [`NSTrackingActiveInKeyWindow`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea/options-swift.struct/activeinkeywindow), [`NSTrackingActiveInActiveApp`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea/options-swift.struct/activeinactiveapp), and [`NSTrackingActiveAlways`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea/options-swift.struct/activealways)). In addition, you may specify any of the behavior constants (that is, [`NSTrackingAssumeInside`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea/options-swift.struct/assumeinside), [`NSTrackingInVisibleRect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea/options-swift.struct/invisiblerect), and [`NSTrackingEnabledDuringMouseDrag`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea/options-swift.struct/enabledduringmousedrag)).

///
/// [`NSMouseExited`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsmouseexited) and [`NSMouseEntered`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsmouseentered) events are paired so their delivery is indirectly affected.

This value specifies a behavior of the tracking area defined by the [`NSTrackingArea`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea).

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// When creating a tracking-area object, you specify a rectangle (in the view’s coordinate system), an owning object, and one or more options, along with (optionally) a dictionary of data. After it’s created, you add the tracking-area object to a view using the [`addTrackingArea:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/addtrackingarea(_:)) method. Depending on the options specified, the owner of the tracking area receives [`mouseEntered:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/mouseentered(with:)), [`mouseExited:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/mouseexited(with:)), [`mouseMoved:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/mousemoved(with:)), and [`cursorUpdate:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsresponder/cursorupdate(with:)) messages when the mouse cursor enters, moves within, and leaves the tracking area. Currently the tracking area is restricted to rectangles.
    ///
    /// An [`NSTrackingArea`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea) object belongs to its view rather than to its window. Consequently, you can add and remove tracking rectangles without needing to worry if the view has been added to a window. In addition, this design makes it possible for the AppKit to compute the geometry of tracking areas automatically when a view moves and, in some cases, when a view changes size.
    ///
    /// Using [`NSTrackingArea`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea), you can configure the scope of activity for mouse tracking. There are four options:
    ///
    /// - The tracking area is active only when the view is first responder.
    ///
    /// - The tracking area is active when the view is in the key window.
    ///
    /// - The tracking area is active when the application is active.
    ///
    /// - The tracking area is active always (even when the application is inactive).
    ///
    /// Other options for [`NSTrackingArea`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea) objects include specifying that the tracking area should be synchronized with the visible rectangle of the view ([`visibleRect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/visiblerect)) and for generating `mouseEntered:` and `mouseExited`: events when the mouse is dragged.
    ///
    /// Other [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview) methods related to [`NSTrackingArea`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea) objects (in addition to [`addTrackingArea:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/addtrackingarea(_:))) include [`removeTrackingArea:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/removetrackingarea(_:)) and [`updateTrackingAreas`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/updatetrackingareas()). Views can override the latter method to recompute and replace their [`NSTrackingArea`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstrackingarea) objects in certain situations, such as a change in the size of the `visibleRect`.
