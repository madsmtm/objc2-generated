    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The `PHPickerViewController` class is an alternative to [`UIImagePickerController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller). `PHPickerViewController` improves stability and reliability, and includes several benefits to developers and users, such as the following:
    ///
    /// - Deferred image loading and recovery UI
    ///
    /// - Reliable handling of large and complex assets, like RAW and panoramic images
    ///
    /// - User-selectable assets that aren’t available for [`UIImagePickerController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller)
    ///
    /// - Configuration of the picker to display only Live Photos
    ///
    /// - Availability of [`PHLivePhoto`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photos/phlivephoto) objects without library access
    ///
    /// - Stricter validations against invalid inputs
    ///
    /// ### Observe required viewing standards
    ///
    /// As a view controller that the system renders on top of your app, the picker controller requires certain prerequisites for operation that your app needs to observe:
    ///
    /// - The picker controller disables user interaction if an app alters its visibility, such as by adjusting the [`opacity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer/opacity) of its view’s layer. In iOS 17 and later, the picker controller ignores touch events while its opacity is anything other than fully opaque.
    ///
    /// - As a system-rendered UI, you can’t subclass [`PHPickerViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photosui/phpickerviewcontroller). Its view hierarchy belongs to the system and therefore, the framework provides no access.
    ///
