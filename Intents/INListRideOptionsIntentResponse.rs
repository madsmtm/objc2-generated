    ///
    /// An [`INListRideOptionsIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inlistrideoptionsintentresponse) object contains your app’s response to a request for ride options that your service offers. SiriKit can ask for a list of ride options at any time. When creating your response object, provide the types of vehicles you can offer in the [`rideOptions`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inlistrideoptionsintentresponse/rideoptions) property. Each option provides information about a specific type of vehicle, including information about the pricing and passenger capacity of those vehicles. You can also provide information about accepted forms of payment and when the list of ride options expires.
    ///
    /// When creating a response object with a code that involves launching the app, always provide a relevant [`NSUserActivity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity) object. The activity object gets delivered to your parent app so that it has the context that it needs to handle the operation.
    ///
    /// You create an [`INListRideOptionsIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inlistrideoptionsintentresponse) object in the [`confirmListRideOptions:completion:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inlistrideoptionsintenthandling/confirm(intent:completion:)) and [`handleListRideOptions:completion:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inlistrideoptionsintenthandling/handle(intent:completion:)) methods of your handler object.
