    /// A request to pause the current workout that also stops the gathering of workout data.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// SiriKit creates an [`INPauseWorkoutIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inpauseworkoutintent) object when the user asks to pause a currently running workout. Pausing a workout stops the gathering of workout data without clearing the current workout progress information. Use this intent object to validate workout parameters.
    ///
    /// To handle this intent, the handler object in your Intents extension must adopt the [`INPauseWorkoutIntentHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inpauseworkoutintenthandling) protocol. Your handler should confirm the request and create an [`INPauseWorkoutIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inpauseworkoutintentresponse) object that indicates it’s possible to pause the workout. SiriKit launches your app and passes it an [`NSUserActivity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity) object that your app must then use to pause the workout.
