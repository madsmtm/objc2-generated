    /// An [`INCarSeatResolutionResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/incarseatresolutionresult) object is what you return when resolving parameters containing a [`INCarSeat`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/incarseat) value. Use the creation method that best reflects your ability to successfully resolve the parameter. For additional resolution options, see [`INIntentResolutionResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inintentresolutionresult).
