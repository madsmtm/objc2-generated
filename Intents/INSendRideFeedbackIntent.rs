    /// An intent indicating that the user provided feedback for a completed ride.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// When the user provides feedback for a completed ride, SiriKit sends an [`INSendRideFeedbackIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insendridefeedbackintent) object to your handler. SiriKit populates this intent object with the ride identifier and the feedback, including a possible driver rating and tip. Upon receiving this intent, validate the provided information and forward it along to your service. SiriKit guarantees that it provides at least one piece of feedback.
    ///
    /// To handle this intent, the handler object in your Intents extension must adopt the [`INSendRideFeedbackIntentHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insendridefeedbackintenthandling) protocol. Your handler should confirm the request and create an [`INSendRideFeedbackIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insendridefeedbackintentresponse) object with the status of the task.
    ///
    /// ### Additional Intent Attributes
    ///

Adopt this protocol in an object of your Intents extension that is capable of conveying the feedback to your service.

    /// To initiate the delivery of an [`INSendRideFeedbackIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insendridefeedbackintent), the user must have previously completed a ride in Maps or Siri and asked the user to provide feedback. Specifically, the [`INRideCompletionStatus`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inridecompletionstatus) object that you created must indicate that it requires feedback before beginning a new ride. (Maps also gives the user a chance to provide feedback proactively). After the user provides feedback, Siri delivers the feedback intent to your Intents extension.
