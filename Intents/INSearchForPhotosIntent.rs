    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The system creates an [`INSearchForPhotosIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insearchforphotosintent) object when the user asks to search for photos in an app. The intent object contains the parameters to use during the search, including the possible name of a photo album, the people in the photos, or the location of the photos. Use this intent object to validate the search parameters and to begin the search process. When performing the search, use only the provided parameters and ignore any that have no values.
    ///
    /// To handle this intent, the handler object in your Intents extension must adopt the [`INSearchForPhotosIntentHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insearchforphotosintenthandling) protocol. Your handler should confirm the request and create an [`INSearchForPhotosIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insearchforphotosintentresponse) object with the results of the search. For successful searches, Siri offers the user a way to launch your app and see the results.
    ///
    /// For a list of other intents in the photos domain, see [`INPhotosDomainHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inphotosdomainhandling).
