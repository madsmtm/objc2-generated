    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Siri creates an [`INSearchForBillsIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insearchforbillsintent) object when the user asks to see pending or already paid bills. The intent object contains the values to match when searching for bills. Users can search for bills based on the due date, the payee, the type, and whether they’re pending or already paid. When performing the search, use only the provided parameters to filter the search results and ignore any parameters that have a missing or unknown value.
    ///
    /// To handle this intent, the handler object in your Intents extension must adopt the [`INSearchForBillsIntentHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insearchforbillsintenthandling) protocol. Your handler should confirm the request and create an [`INSearchForBillsIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insearchforbillsintentresponse) object with the results of the search. For successful searches, Siri offers a way for the user to view the results.
    ///
    /// ### Additional Intent Attributes
    ///
    /// The following table lists additional attributes of this intent object:

    /// (TODO table: Table { header: "row", extended_data: None, rows: [[[Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Attribute" }] }], [Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Description" }] }]], [[Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Supported by" }] }], [Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Siri Intents" }] }]], [[Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Always requires unlocked device" }] }], [Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Yes" }] }]]], alignments: None, metadata: None })
