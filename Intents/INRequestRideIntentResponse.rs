    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// An [`INRequestRideIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inrequestrideintentresponse) object contains your app’s response to a ride-booking request. After creating your response object, assign an appropriate object to the [`rideStatus`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inrequestrideintentresponse/ridestatus) property. The ride status object provides the details about how you handled the ride, including details about selected vehicle type, pricing, driver information, pickup time, pickup location, drop-off location, and so on. Siri and Maps display your response information to the user during the confirmation and booking phases.
    ///
    /// Siri and Maps expect your response to contain a valid [`INRideStatus`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inridestatus) object with information about the ride. Specifically, your status object must include a valid [`INRideOption`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inrideoption) object and you should always specify an activity object in the [`userActivityForCancelingInApplication`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inridestatus/useractivityforcancelinginapplication) property of your status object. When handling the intent, the [`INRequestRideIntentResponseCodeUnspecified`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inrequestrideintentresponsecode/unspecified) and [`INRequestRideIntentResponseCodeReady`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inrequestrideintentresponsecode/ready) codes generate an error and should not be used.
    ///
    /// You create an [`INRequestRideIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inrequestrideintentresponse) object in the [`confirmRequestRide:completion:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inrequestrideintenthandling/confirm(intent:completion:)) and [`handleRequestRide:completion:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inrequestrideintenthandling/handle(intent:completion:)) methods of your handler object. For more information about implementing your handler object, see [`INRequestRideIntentHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inrequestrideintenthandling).
