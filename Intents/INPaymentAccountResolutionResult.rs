    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// An [`INPaymentAccountResolutionResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inpaymentaccountresolutionresult) object is what you return when resolving parameters containing an [`INPaymentAccount`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inpaymentaccount) object. Use the creation method that best reflects your ability to resolve the parameter successfully. For additional resolution options, see [`INIntentResolutionResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inintentresolutionresult).
