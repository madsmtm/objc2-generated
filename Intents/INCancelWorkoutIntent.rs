    /// A request to cancel an active workout.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// SiriKit creates an [`INCancelWorkoutIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/incancelworkoutintent) object when the user asks to cancel a currently running workout. Canceling a workout stops the workout and doesn’t record any progress toward the workout goals. Use this intent object to get the workout parameters.
    ///
    /// To handle this intent, the handler object in your Intents extension must adopt the [`INCancelWorkoutIntentHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/incancelworkoutintenthandling) protocol. Your handler should confirm the request and create an [`INCancelWorkoutIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/incancelworkoutintentresponse) object to indicate it’s possible to cancel the workout. For the successful handling of the intent, SiriKit launches your app and passes it an [`NSUserActivity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity) object that your app must then use to cancel the workout.
    ///
    /// ### Additional Intent Attributes
