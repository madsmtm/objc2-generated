    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Siri creates an [`INSendPaymentIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insendpaymentintent) object when the current user asks to transfer money to another user. A send payment intent object includes the payment amount and the recipient of the payment. Use that information to validate the transaction and transfer the funds.
    ///
    /// To handle this intent, the handler object in your Intents extension must adopt the [`INSendPaymentIntentHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insendpaymentintenthandling) protocol. Your handler should confirm the request and create an [`INSendPaymentIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insendpaymentintentresponse) object with the result of sending the money to the specified user.
    ///
    /// This intent object represents a financial transaction between two users.
