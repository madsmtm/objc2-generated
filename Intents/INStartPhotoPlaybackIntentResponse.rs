    /// Use an [`INStartPhotoPlaybackIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/instartphotoplaybackintentresponse) object to specify the status of searching the user’s photos and the readiness of your app to begin playing those photos in a slideshow. After performing a search using the criteria specified in the [`INStartPhotoPlaybackIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/instartphotoplaybackintent) object, create an instance of this class with the results. Siri communicates the status from your response to the user at appropriate times.
