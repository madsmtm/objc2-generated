    /// A request to transfer money between two accounts.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Siri creates an [`INTransferMoneyIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/intransfermoneyintent) object when the user asks to transfer money between two accounts. Transfers can occur only between accounts associated with the user. Use the information provided by the intent object to identify the involved accounts and the amount to transfer.
    ///
    /// To handle this intent, the handler object in your Intents extension must adopt the [`INTransferMoneyIntentHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/intransfermoneyintenthandling) protocol. Your handler should confirm the request and create an [`INTransferMoneyIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/intransfermoneyintentresponse) object with the transaction details. For successful transfers, Siri offers a way for the user to view the results.
    ///
    /// ### Additional Intent Attributes
    ///
    /// The following table lists additional attributes of this intent object:
    ///
    /// (TODO table: Table { header: "row", extended_data: None, rows: [[[Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Attribute" }] }], [Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Description" }] }]], [[Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Supported by" }] }], [Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Siri Intents, Siri Suggestions" }] }]], [[Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Always requires unlocked device" }] }], [Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Yes" }] }]]], alignments: None, metadata: None })
    /// When performing a search, Siri automatically asks the user to unlock a currently locked device. You don’t need to explicitly ask to unlock the device. In addition, Siri always prompts the user to confirm the request before asking your Intents extension to handle it.
