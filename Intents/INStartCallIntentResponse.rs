    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Use an [`INStartCallIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/instartcallintentresponse) object to specify whether your app is able to initiate an audio or video call. You create instances of this class when confirming and handling an [`INStartCallIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/instartcallintent) object. When it’s time to call the user, SiriKit launches your app and delivers the [`NSUserActivity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity) object contained in this object. Use that user activity object to specify any additional information that assists your app in placing the call.
    ///
    /// You create an [`INStartCallIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/instartcallintentresponse) object in the [`confirmStartCall:completion:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/instartcallintenthandling/confirm(intent:completion:)) and [`handleStartCall:completion:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/instartcallintenthandling/handle(intent:completion:)) methods of your start call handler object. For more information about implementing your handler object, see [`INStartCallIntentHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/instartcallintenthandling).
