    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// You return an `INCallRecordResolutionResult` object when resolving parameters containing an [`INCallRecord`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/incallrecord) value. The `resolvedCallRecord` can be different than the original `INCallRecord`. This flexibility allows app extensions to apply business logic constraints.
    ///
    /// Use [`notRequired`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inintentresolutionresult/notrequired()) to continue with a `nil` value. For additional resolution operators, see [`INIntentResolutionResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inintentresolutionresult).
