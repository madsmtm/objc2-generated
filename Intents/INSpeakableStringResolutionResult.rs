    ///
    /// An [`INSpeakableStringResolutionResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inspeakablestringresolutionresult) object is what you return when resolving parameters containing an [`INSpeakableString`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inspeakablestring) object. Use the creation method that best reflects your ability to successfully resolve the parameter.
