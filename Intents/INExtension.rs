    /// The entry point for an Intents extension.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The [`INExtension`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inextension) class is the principal class of your Intents extension, which provides information to SiriKit. Your extension object acts like a dispatcher, providing SiriKit with the objects it needs to resolve and handle requests. This class defines no methods of its own, but it adopts the [`INIntentHandlerProviding`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inintenthandlerproviding) protocol, which contains the main method you must implement.
    ///
    /// You do not create instances of this class directly. When the system needs your Intents extension to handle a request, it automatically instantiates the class specified in the `NSExtensionPrincipalClass` key of the extension’s `Info.plist` file. All you have to do is provide the implementation for that class.
    ///
    /// Your extension object must be able to return handler objects for all of the intents that your app supports. The Intents framework supports the following types of intents:
    ///
    /// - VoIP calling intents support audio and video calls to another user of your app.
    ///
    /// - Workout intents support the starting and stopping of workouts.
    ///
    /// - Message intents support the sending of message data to specific users.
    ///
    /// - Payment intents support financial transactions between users.
    ///
    /// - Photo intents support the searching and displaying of photos.
    ///
    /// - Ride-booking intents support the booking and management of user transportation from Siri or Maps.
    ///
    /// - CarPlay intents support the changing of settings in automobiles that support CarPlay.
    ///
    /// - Restaurant reservation intents support the creating and viewing of restaurant reservations in Maps.
    ///
    /// For more information about implementing your extension’s main dispatching method, see [`INIntentHandlerProviding`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inintenthandlerproviding). For information about how to implement this class in your Intents extension, see [SiriKit Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Intents/Conceptual/SiriIntegrationGuide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016875).
