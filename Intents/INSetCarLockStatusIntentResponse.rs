    /// Use an `INSetCarLockStatusIntentResponse` object to specify the result of a request to lock or unlock the user’s car. You create instances of this class when confirming or handling a set car lock intent. Use this object to confirm that the request is valid and communicate whether the car was successfully locked or unlocked, or to report any errors that occur.
