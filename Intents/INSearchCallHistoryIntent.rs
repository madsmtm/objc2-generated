    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// SiriKit creates [`INSearchCallHistoryIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insearchcallhistoryintent) objects when the user asks to see previous calls from their call history. This intent object contains the values for you to match when searching the user’s call history. Users can search for calls involving a specific person, calls that occurred on specific dates, or calls that are of a specific type such as missed calls. When performing the search, use only the parameters provided and ignore any that have no values.
    ///
    /// To handle this intent, the handler object in your Intents extension must adopt the [`INSearchCallHistoryIntentHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insearchcallhistoryintenthandling) protocol. Your handler confirms the request and creates an [`INSearchCallHistoryIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insearchcallhistoryintentresponse) object with the results of the search. For successful searches, Siri offers the user a way to launch your app and see the results.
