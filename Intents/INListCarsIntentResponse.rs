    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Use an `INListCarsIntentResponse` to specify the result of a request from Maps for a list of the user’s electric vehicles. You create instances of this class when confirming or handling a List Cars intent. Use this object to confirm the request is valid and return a list of the user’s cars, or to report any errors that occur. Each entry in the [`cars`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inlistcarsintentresponse/cars) array provides information about one of the user’s electric vehicles, including its unique car identifier and model information, such as name and year.
    ///
    /// When creating a response that requires the system to launch your host app, always provide a relevant [`NSUserActivity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity) object. This ensures your host app has the context it needs to handle the operation.
    ///
    /// You create an `INListCarsIntentResponse` in the [`confirmListCars:completion:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inlistcarsintenthandling/confirm(intent:completion:)) and [`handleListCars:completion:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inlistcarsintenthandling/handle(intent:completion:)) methods of your handler object. For more information about implementing your handler object, see [`INListCarsIntentHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inlistcarsintenthandling).
