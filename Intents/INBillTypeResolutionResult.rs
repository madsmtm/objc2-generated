    /// You create [`INBillTypeResolutionResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inbilltyperesolutionresult) objects when resolving intent parameters containing a value of type [`INBillType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inbilltype). Use the creation method that best reflects your ability to resolve the parameter. For additional resolution options, see [`INIntentResolutionResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inintentresolutionresult).
