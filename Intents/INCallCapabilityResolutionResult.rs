    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// You return an `INCallCapabilityResolutionResult` object when resolving parameters containing an [`INCallCapability`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/incallcapability) value. Use the creation method that best reflects your ability to resolve the parameter successfully. The resolved value can be different than the original [`INCallCapability`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/incallcapability). This flexibility allows app extensions to apply business logic constraints.
    ///
    /// Use [`notRequired`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inintentresolutionresult/notrequired()) to continue with a `nil` value. For additional resolution operators, see [`INIntentResolutionResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inintentresolutionresult).
