    /// An intent for retrieving a list of the user’s electric vehicles.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Maps creates instances of `INListCarsIntent` when it needs to display a list of the user’s electric vehicles, usually before or during route planning.
    ///
    /// To handle this intent, you create an object that conforms to the [`INListCarsIntentHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inlistcarsintenthandling) protocol. The object handles, and optionally confirms, the request by providing an instance of [`INListCarsIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inlistcarsintentresponse). The response contains an array of [`INCar`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/incar) objects, one for each of the user’s electric vehicles. Maps requires that each vehicle responds to [`INGetCarPowerLevelStatusIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/ingetcarpowerlevelstatusintent) requests so that it can use the information the intent provides—current charge, battery capacity, distance remaining, and so forth—to more accurately plan the route.
