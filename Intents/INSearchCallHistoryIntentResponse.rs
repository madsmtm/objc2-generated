    ///
    /// Use an [`INSearchCallHistoryIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insearchcallhistoryintentresponse) object to specify the results of searching the user’s call history. After performing a search using the criteria specified in the [`INSearchCallHistoryIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insearchcallhistoryintent) object, create an instance of this class with the results of that search.
    ///
    /// Your app is responsible for displaying the results of your search, so you must communicate the results to it. One way to communicate those results is through the [`NSUserActivity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity) object that you create with your response. After creating that object, place the results in its [`userInfo`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity/userinfo) dictionary.
    ///
    /// You create an [`INSearchCallHistoryIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insearchcallhistoryintentresponse) object in the [`confirmSearchCallHistory:completion:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insearchcallhistoryintenthandling/confirm(intent:completion:)) and [`handleSearchCallHistory:completion:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/insearchcallhistoryintenthandling/handle(intent:completion:)) methods of your search call history handler object.
