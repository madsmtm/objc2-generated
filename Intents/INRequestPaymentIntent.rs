    /// An intent for requesting money from another user’s account.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Siri creates an [`INRequestPaymentIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inrequestpaymentintent) object when the current user requests a payment from another user. A request payment intent object includes the payment amount and the person receiving the request. This intent represents only a request for payment and shouldn’t initiate any payments.
    ///
    /// To handle this intent, the handler object in your Intents extension must adopt the [`INRequestPaymentIntentHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inrequestpaymentintenthandling) protocol. Your handler should confirm the request and create an [`INRequestPaymentIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inrequestpaymentintentresponse) object with the results of making the request.
    ///
    /// ### Additional Intent Attributes
    ///
    /// The following table lists additional attributes of this intent object:
    ///
    /// (TODO table: Table { header: "row", extended_data: None, rows: [[[Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Attribute" }] }], [Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Description" }] }]], [[Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Supported by" }] }], [Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Siri Intents, Siri Suggestions, Shortcuts app" }] }]], [[Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Always requires unlocked device" }] }], [Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Yes" }] }]]], alignments: None, metadata: None })
    /// When performing a search, Siri automatically asks the user to unlock a currently locked device. You don’t need to explicitly ask to unlock the device. In addition, Siri always prompts the user to confirm the request before asking your Intents extension to handle it.
