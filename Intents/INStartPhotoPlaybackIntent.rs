    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The system creates an [`INStartPhotoPlaybackIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/instartphotoplaybackintent) object when the user asks to start a slideshow of a set of photos. This intent object contains the parameters to use when searching for the photos, including the possible name of a photo album, the people in the photos, or the location of the photos. Use this intent object to perform the search and initiate the slideshow in your app. When performing the search, use only the parameters provided and ignore any that have no values.
    ///
    /// To handle this intent, the handler object in your Intents extension must adopt the [`INStartPhotoPlaybackIntentHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/instartphotoplaybackintenthandling) protocol. Your handler should confirm the request and create an [`INStartPhotoPlaybackIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/instartphotoplaybackintentresponse) object with the results of the search. After a successful search, Siri launches your app so that it can begin the slideshow.
    ///
    /// For a list of other intents in the photos domain, see [`INPhotosDomainHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inphotosdomainhandling).
