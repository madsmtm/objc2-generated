    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// SiriKit creates an [`INEndWorkoutIntent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inendworkoutintent) object when the user asks to finish an in-progress workout. Finishing a workout stops it and records any progress made toward the workout’s goals. Use this intent object to validate the workout parameters.
    ///
    /// To handle this intent, the handler object in your Intents extension must adopt the [`INEndWorkoutIntentHandling`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inendworkoutintenthandling) protocol. Your handler should confirm the request and create an [`INEndWorkoutIntentResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/intents/inendworkoutintentresponse) object that indicates it’s possible to end the workout. For the successful handling of the intent, SiriKit launches your app and passes it an [`NSUserActivity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity) object your app must then use to end the workout.
