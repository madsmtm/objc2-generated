    ///
    /// Each [`PHAsset`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photos/phasset) object references one or more resources. Use these objects to work with those resources directly, like when backing up or restoring assets.
    ///
    /// - A photo asset can contain both JPEG and RAW files representing the same photo.
    ///
    /// - A Live Photo asset contains both still photo and video resources.
    ///
    /// - An edited asset contains resources representing asset content before and after the edit, as well as a resource corresponding to the [`PHAdjustmentData`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photos/phadjustmentdata) object that describes the edit.
    ///
    /// To work with the data contained in an asset resource, fetch it using the [`PHAssetResourceManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photos/phassetresourcemanager) class.
