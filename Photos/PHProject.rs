    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// This class represents the project when extended from macOS Photos. Projects can have the following types:
    ///
    /// - Book
    ///
    /// - Calendar
    ///
    /// - Card
    ///
    /// - Prints
    ///
    /// - Slideshow
    ///
    /// - Wall decor
    ///
    /// Users create projects by selecting one or more assets, right-clicking the selection, and grouping the assets, much like an album collection. Your app treats the project as a separate entity, represented as a [`PHProject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photos/phproject).
