/// ## Discussion
///
/// If you request an asset resource whose data is not on the local device, and you have enabled downloading with the [`networkAccessAllowed`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photos/phassetresourcerequestoptions/isnetworkaccessallowed) property, Photos calls your block periodically to report progress.

/// The block takes a single parameter:
///
/// - progress: A floating-point value indicating the progress of the download. A value of `0.0` indicates that the download has just started, and a value of `1.0` indicates the download is complete.
