/// The specification that sets the desired role or roles for an app to claim for an item or a family of items.

/// ## Overview
///
/// This bit mask is passed to functions that find the preferred app for an item or family of items (`LSGetApplicationForItem`, `LSGetApplicationForURL`, `LSGetApplicationForInfo`), or that determine whether an app can open a designated item (`LSCanRefAcceptItem`, `LSCanURLAcceptURL`), to specify the app’s desired role or roles for the item. For example, to request only an editor app, specify `kLSRolesEditor`. If either an editor or a viewer app is acceptable, specify `kLSRolesEditor | kLSRolesViewer`.
