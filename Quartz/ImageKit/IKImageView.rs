    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The `IKImageView` class provides an efficient way to display images in a view while at the same time supporting a number of image editing operations such as rotating, zooming, and cropping. If possible, image rendering uses hardware acceleration to achieve optimal performance. The `IKImageView` class is implemented as a subclass of [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview). Similar to [`NSImageView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimageview), the `IKImageView` class is used to display a single image.
    ///
    /// You can provide an images for the view in any of these formats:
    ///
    /// - File reference ([`NSURL`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurl), [`CFURLRef`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfurl), or a path)
    ///
    /// - [`CGImageSourceRef`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageio/cgimagesource)
    ///
    /// - Data ([`NSData`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdata) or [`CFDataRef`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfdata))
    ///
    /// - Image ([`CGImageRef`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgimage) or [`CIImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/ciimage))
    ///
    /// Providing a file reference is the preferred way to set the the image for a view because in addition to the actual image data, `IKImageView` also handles the image metadata embedded in the file. The image view automatically fetches the metadata from a file reference, whereas for the other sources (except for a [`CGImageSourceRef`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageio/cgimagesource) source), it cannot. For images set from other sources, you need to set the metadata separately.
    ///
    /// `IKImageView` supports multi-frame images (TIFF, GIF, and so forth) and animated images.
