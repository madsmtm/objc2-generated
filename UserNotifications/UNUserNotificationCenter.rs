    ///
    /// - Request authorization to interact with the user through alerts, sounds, and icon badges. See [Asking permission to use notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/asking-permission-to-use-notifications).
    ///

    ///
    /// - Schedule the delivery of notifications from your app. See [Scheduling a notification locally from your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/scheduling-a-notification-locally-from-your-app).

    /// - Process the payloads from remote notifications the system delivers by Apple Push Notification service (APNs). See [Handling notifications and notification-related actions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/handling-notifications-and-notification-related-actions).
    ///
    /// - Manage the already delivered notifications the system displays in Notification Center. See Managing Delivered Notifications.

    /// Use the methods of the [`UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unusernotificationcenterdelegate) protocol to handle user-selected actions from notifications, and to process notifications that arrive when your app is running in the foreground. After implementing these methods in an object, assign that object to the [`delegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unusernotificationcenter/delegate) property of the shared [`UNUserNotificationCenter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unusernotificationcenter) object. The user notification center object calls the methods of your delegate at appropriate times.

    ///
    /// ### Important
    ///  You must assign your delegate object to the [`UNUserNotificationCenter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unusernotificationcenter) object before your app finishes launching. For example, in an iOS app, you must assign it in the [`application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/application(_:willfinishlaunchingwithoptions:)) or [`application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/application(_:didfinishlaunchingwithoptions:)) method of your app delegate. Assigning a delegate after the system calls these methods might cause you to miss incoming notifications.
