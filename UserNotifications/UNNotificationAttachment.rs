    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Create a [`UNNotificationAttachment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationattachment) object when you want to include audio, image, or video content together in an alert-based notification. When creating the [`UNNotificationAttachment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationattachment) object, the file you specify must be on disk, and the file format must be one of the supported types.
    ///
    /// You’re responsible for supplying attachments before the system displays your notification’s alert. For local notifications, add attachments when creating the notification’s content. For remote notifications, use a notification service app extension to download the attached files and then add them to the notification’s content before delivery.
    ///
    /// The system validates attachments before displaying the associated notification. If you attach a file to a local notification request that’s corrupted, invalid, or of an unsupported file type, the system doesn’t schedule your request. For remote notifications, the system validates attachments after your notification service app extension finishes. Once validated, the system moves the attached files into the attachment data store so that the appropriate processes can access the files. The system copies attachments located inside an app’s bundle.
    ///
    /// ### Supported File Types
    ///
    /// Table 1 lists the types of files you can include as an attachment and the supported file formats. The table also lists the maximum size allowed for attachments of each type. An image file may contain a static image or an animated image sequence.
    ///
    /// Table 1. Supported attachment file types

    /// When creating an attachment, you can specify optional details about how to present the thumbnail image for the image or movie. Use the [`UNNotificationAttachmentOptionsThumbnailClippingRectKey`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationattachmentoptionsthumbnailclippingrectkey) option to use only the specified portion of an image as a thumbnail. For animated images and movies, use the [`UNNotificationAttachmentOptionsThumbnailTimeKey`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationattachmentoptionsthumbnailtimekey) option to select which frame to use for the thumbnail image.
