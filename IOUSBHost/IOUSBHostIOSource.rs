/// Encapsulates descriptors for a single endpoint
///
/// The IOUSBHostIOSourceDescriptors struct is used to initialize and adjust
/// pipes in the system. The bcdUSB member must be initialized to the USB revision
/// supported by the device. Acceptable values are 0x0110, 0x0200, 0x0300, 0x0310. The
/// descriptor member must always be initialized with a valid endpoint descriptor. The
/// ssCompanionDescriptor and sspCompanionDescriptor members may be
/// required for bcdUSB versions 0x0300 and greater, depending on device operating
/// speed and values set in the descriptors.  See USB 3.1 § 9.5 for more information on
/// when these descriptors may be required.
