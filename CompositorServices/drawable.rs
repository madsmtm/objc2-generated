///
/// When you draw a frame of content, the frame’s  [`cp_drawable_t`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/compositorservices/cp_drawable_t) type provides the actual textures and rendering information you need. Do as much work as possible in advance to prepare for rendering, and retrieve the [`cp_drawable_t`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/compositorservices/cp_drawable_t) only when you’re ready to start encoding commands into your Metal command buffers. The system recycles frames and their drawables for efficiency, so if you retrieve the drawable too early, it might not be ready to use.
///
/// Use the drawable’s [`LayerRenderer.Drawable.View`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/compositorservices/layerrenderer/drawable/view) instances to determine where to draw your content in the provided textures. After you finish encoding your content, call [`encodePresent(commandBuffer:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/compositorservices/layerrenderer/drawable/encodepresent(commandbuffer:)) to add a presentation notification to your command buffer. This command tells Compositor Services when to display the frame, and is essential for displaying your frame on time.
