    /// As MailKit downloads messages, it invokes the [`decideActionForMessage:completionHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mailkit/memessageactionhandler/decideaction(for:completionhandler:)) method on your handler. You indicate the action to take for each message, such as marking it as read or unread, flagging it, or archiving it.
    ///
    /// To indicate that your extension contains a message action handler, add `MEMessageActionHandler` to the [`MEExtensionCapabilities`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/nsextension/nsextensionattributes/meextensioncapabilities) array in the extension’s `Info.plist` file:
