    ///
    /// Before you create a `GKMatchmakerViewController` object, create a [`GKMatchRequest`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkmatchrequest) object and configure it according to the parameters of your game. Then pass the match request to the [`initWithMatchRequest:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkmatchmakerviewcontroller/init(matchrequest:)) initializer to create the view controller.
    ///
    /// Configure the view controller and set its delegate before you present it to the local player. The view controller allows the local player to choose other players and, optionally, fill empty slots using automatch. If you add the Group Activities capability to your Xcode project, the player can invite others using SharePlay. See [Configuring Group Activities](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-group-activities).
    ///
    /// Implement the [`GKLocalPlayerListener`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gklocalplayerlistener) and [`GKMatchmakerViewControllerDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkmatchmakerviewcontrollerdelegate) protocols to handle when players send and accept invitations. Implement the [`player:didAcceptInvite:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkinviteeventlistener/player(_:didaccept:)) delegate method to present a `GKMatchmakerViewController` object, which you create using the [`initWithInvite:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkmatchmakerviewcontroller/init(invite:)) initializer, to the player who accepts an invitation. Then, implement the [`matchmakerViewController:didFindMatch:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkmatchmakerviewcontrollerdelegate/matchmakerviewcontroller(_:didfind:)) delegate method to dismiss the view controller and start the game when all players accept their invitations.
    ///
    /// In iOS, you present and dismiss the view controller from another view controller in your game, using the methods from the [`UIViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller) class. If you use SwiftUI, you can get the root view controller from the [`UIApplication`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication) object.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// let rootViewController = UIApplication.shared.windows.first!.rootViewController
    /// ```
    ///
    /// For visionOS games, the view controller appears anchored to the window, scene, or view relative to where you present the view controller. For immersive games, set the parent window to a separate window group than the immersive space window group.
    ///
    /// For macOS games, use the [`GKDialogController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkdialogcontroller) class to present and dismiss the view controller.
    ///
