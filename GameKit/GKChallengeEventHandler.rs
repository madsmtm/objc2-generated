    ///
    /// - The local player receives a challenge.
    ///
    /// - The local player completes a challenge.
    ///
    /// - A remote player completes a challenge issued by the local player.
    ///
    /// Your event handler can override or extend this behavior:
    ///
    /// - It can prevent a banner from being displayed.
    ///
    /// - It can be notified when a player taps in a banner.
    ///
    /// - It can handle the events directly.
    ///
