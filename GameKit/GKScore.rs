    ///  Your game must initialize a local player before you can use any Game Center classes. If there is no initialized player, your game receives a [`GKErrorNotAuthenticated`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkerror/code/notauthenticated) error. For more information, see [Authenticating a player](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/authenticating-a-player).

    /// Your game creates `GKScore` objects to post scores to a leaderboard on Game Center. When your game retrieves score information from a leaderboard, those scores are returned as `GKScore` objects.
    ///
    /// Scores and leaderboards work together to help you create a better game. Whenever a new `GKScore` object is created, it is associated with a leaderboard. You must ensure that the score being sent to a leaderboard is compatible with the leaderboard scoring format set in App Store Connect. See [Leaderboards and Leaderboard Sets](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnectGameCenter_Guide/Leaderboards/Leaderboards.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013726-CH2) for information on how to create a leaderboard in App Store Connect.
    ///
    /// To report a score to Game Center, your game allocates and initializes a new object, sets the [`value`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkscore/value) property to the score the player earned, and then calls the [`reportScoreWithCompletionHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkscore/report(completionhandler:)) method. The mechanism your game uses to calculate scores is up to you to design; scores are only compared within your game.
