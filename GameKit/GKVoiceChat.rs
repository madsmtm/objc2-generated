    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// GameKit provides the underlying mechanism to implement voice chat between players in a multiplayer game. It’s your responsibility to provide player controls and display feedback during the chat.
    ///
    /// First, configure voice chat by adding the [`NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/nsmicrophoneusagedescription) key to the Information Property List and creating an audio session. Then, create a `GKVoiceChat` object using the `GKMatch` [`voiceChatWithName:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkmatch/voicechat(withname:)) method passing a string that identifies the voice channel. Use the [`start`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkvoicechat/start()) method to connect players to the channel. Use the [`active`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkvoicechat/isactive) property to activate the microphone or switch the microphone between channels.
    ///
    /// Provide a handler using the [`playerVoiceChatStateDidChangeHandler`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkvoicechat/playervoicechatstatedidchangehandler) property to update the interface when a player connects, speaks, or disconnects from a chat. You can also add controls that mute and set the volume using the [`setPlayer:muted:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkvoicechat/setplayer(_:muted:)) method and [`volume`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkvoicechat/volume) property.
    ///
    /// Note that if there’s insufficient bandwidth over Wi-Fi to maintain a voice chat, GameKit may disconnect players from the channel or disband a channel.
    ///
    ///
