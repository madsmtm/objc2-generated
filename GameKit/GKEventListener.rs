    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Your game can ignore a challenge, start up in a specific state so the local player can respond to a challenge, or notify the challenger when the local player completes a challenge.
    ///
    /// Don’t implement [`GKChallengeListener`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkchallengelistener) directly; instead use [`GKLocalPlayerListener`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gklocalplayerlistener). The [`GKLocalPlayerListener`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gklocalplayerlistener) protocol inherits methods from [`GKChallengeListener`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkchallengelistener), [`GKInviteEventListener`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkinviteeventlistener), [`GKSavedGameListener`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gksavedgamelistener), and [`GKTurnBasedEventListener`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkturnbasedeventlistener) in order to handle multiple events.
