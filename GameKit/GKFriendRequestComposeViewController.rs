    /// Your game uses the `GKFriendRequestComposeViewController` class to present a screen that allows the local player to send friend requests to other players.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Important
    ///  Your game must initialize a local player before you can use any Game Center classes. If there is no initialized player, your game receives a [`GKErrorNotAuthenticated`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkerror/code/notauthenticated) error. For more information, see [Authenticating a player](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/authenticating-a-player).
    ///
    ///
    ///
    /// </div>
    /// To show a friend request, initialize a new `GKFriendRequestComposeViewController` object and set the delegate. Optionally, you can customize the request by adding a text message or a list of recipients. Then, present the new view controller and wait for the delegate to be called. Once the delegate is called, dismiss the view controller.
    ///
    /// On iOS, you present and dismiss the view controller from another view controller in your game, using the methods provided by the [`UIViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller) class. In macOS, you use the [`GKDialogController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkdialogcontroller) class to present and dismiss the view controller. The listing below shows one way your view controller can allow a player to send a request to other players. For this method, an array of [`GKPlayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkplayer) objects is passed in as a parameter. The method instantiates a `GKFriendRequestComposeViewController` object, sets its delegate, and adds the list of players intended to receive the invitation. The view controller then presents the friend request and returns.
    ///
    /// ```objc
    /// - (void) inviteFriends: (NSArray*) players
    /// {
    ///     GKFriendRequestComposeViewController *friendRequestViewController = [[GKFriendRequestComposeViewController alloc] init];
    ///     friendRequestViewController.composeViewDelegate = self;
    ///     if (players.count)
    ///     {
    ///         [friendRequestViewController addRecipientPlayers: players];
    ///     }
    ///     [self presentViewController: friendRequestViewController animated: YES completion:nil];
    ///     [friendRequestViewController release];
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ### Subclassing Notes

    /// The [`GKFriendRequestComposeViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkfriendrequestcomposeviewcontroller) class is not intended to be subclassed.
