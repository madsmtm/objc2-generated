    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// A [`GKLeaderboardScore`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkleaderboardscore) object represents a score on a leaderboard for scores you report for challenges or turn-based games.
    ///
    /// When you create a [`GKLeaderboardScore`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkleaderboardscore) object, set the `leaderboardID` property to the associated leaderboard, the `player` property to the player who earns the score, and the `value` property to the score. Make sure the score is compatible with the score format that you configure in App Store Connect.
    ///
    /// Then use either the [`reportLeaderboardScores:withEligibleChallenges:withCompletionHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkscore/report(_:witheligiblechallenges:withcompletionhandler:)-2tycl) or [`endMatchInTurnWithMatchData:leaderboardScores:achievements:completionHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkturnbasedmatch/endmatchinturn(withmatch:leaderboardscores:achievements:completionhandler:)) `GKTurnBasedMatch` method to report one or more scores.
    ///
    /// For details about the score format, see [Configure leaderboards](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/configure-leaderboards) in App Store Connect Help.
