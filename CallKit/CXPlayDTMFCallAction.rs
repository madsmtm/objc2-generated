    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// [`CXPlayDTMFCallAction`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxplaydtmfcallaction) is a concrete subclass of [`CXCallAction`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxcallaction). Whenever digits are transmitted during a call, whether from a user interacting with a number pad or following a hard or soft pause, the provider sends [`provider:performPlayDTMFCallAction:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxproviderdelegate/provider(_:perform:)-4htxt) to its delegate. The provider’s delegate calls the [`fulfill`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxaction/fulfill()) method to indicate that the action was successfully performed.
    ///
    /// The provider sends [`provider:performPlayDTMFCallAction:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxproviderdelegate/provider(_:perform:)-4htxt) for successive actions only after the current action is fulfilled. When interacting with the number pad, each entered digit constitutes its own action. Digits following a hard or soft pause, however, are passed to [`provider:performPlayDTMFCallAction:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxproviderdelegate/provider(_:perform:)-4htxt) as a single string of digits. For example, if a user taps the 4 button on the number pad, followed by the 2 button, the delegate is sent [`provider:performPlayDTMFCallAction:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxproviderdelegate/provider(_:perform:)-4htxt) for the digit `4` and waits for the action to be fulfilled; after the action is fulfilled, the delegate is sent [`provider:performPlayDTMFCallAction:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxproviderdelegate/provider(_:perform:)-4htxt) for the digit `2`.
    ///
    /// CallKit automatically plays the corresponding DTMF frequencies for any digits transmitted over a call. The app is responsible for managing the timing and handling of digits as part of fulfilling the action.
