    /// An encapsulation of the act of answering an incoming call.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// [`CXAnswerCallAction`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxanswercallaction) is a concrete subclass of [`CXCallAction`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxcallaction).
    ///
    /// When an incoming call is allowed by the system and approved by the user, the provider sends [`provider:performAnswerCallAction:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxproviderdelegate/provider(_:perform:)-h4in) to its delegate. The provider’s delegate calls the [`fulfill`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxaction/fulfill()) method to indicate that the action was successfully performed. To indicate that the call connected at a time other than the current time, you can instead call the [`fulfillWithDateConnected:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxanswercallaction/fulfill(withdateconnected:)).
