    /// [`CXEndCallAction`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxendcallaction) is a concrete subclass of [`CXCallAction`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxcallaction). When the user initiates an outgoing call, the provider sends [`provider:performEndCallAction:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxproviderdelegate/provider(_:perform:)-9a0m) to its delegate. The provider’s delegate calls the [`fulfill`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxaction/fulfill()) method to indicate that the action was successfully performed. To indicate that the call ended at a time other than the current time, you can instead call the [`fulfillWithDateEnded:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxendcallaction/fulfill(withdateended:))
