    /// An encapsulation of the act of muting or unmuting a call.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// [`CXSetMutedCallAction`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxsetmutedcallaction) is a concrete subclass of [`CXCallAction`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxcallaction). When the user or the system mutes a call, the provider sends [`provider:performSetMutedCallAction:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxproviderdelegate/provider(_:perform:)-4u3yu) to its delegate. The provider’s delegate calls the [`fulfill`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxaction/fulfill()) method to indicate that the action was successfully performed. When a caller mutes a call, that caller is unable to communicate with other callers until they unmute the call. A muted caller still receives communication from other unmuted callers.
