    /// You can retrieve a list of active calls on an [`CXCallObserver`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxcallobserver) object using the [`calls`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxcallobserver/calls) property. You can also provide an object conforming to the [`CXCallObserverDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxcallobserverdelegate) protocol as the call observer delegate using the [`setDelegate:queue:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxcallobserver/setdelegate(_:queue:)) method to respond to any active call changes.
    ///
    /// VoIP apps typically interact with the [`CXCallObserver`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxcallobserver) object returned by the [`callObserver`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxcallcontroller/callobserver) property of a [`CXCallController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxcallcontroller) instance. However, any app can create a new [`CXCallObserver`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxcallobserver) object to be notified of any calls activity on the system.
