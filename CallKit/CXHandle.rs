    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// When the telephony provider receives an incoming call or the user starts an outgoing call, the other caller is identified by a [`CXHandle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxhandle) object. For a caller identified by a phone number, the handle type is [`CXHandleTypePhoneNumber`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxhandle/handletype/phonenumber) and the value is a sequence of digits. For a caller identified by an email address, the handle type is [`CXHandleTypeEmailAddress`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxhandle/handletype/emailaddress) and the value is an email address. For a caller identified in any other way, the handle type is [`CXHandleTypeGeneric`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxhandle/handletype/generic) and the value typically follows some domain-specific format, such as a username, numeric ID, or URL.
