For example, when [`type`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/cksyncengineevent/type) is set to [`CKSyncEngineEventType.stateUpdate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/cksyncengineeventtype/stateupdate), use the [`stateUpdateEvent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/cksyncengineevent/stateupdateevent) property to get the downcast reference .
