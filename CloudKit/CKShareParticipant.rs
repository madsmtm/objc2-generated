    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Participants are a key element of sharing in CloudKit. A participant provides information about an iCloud user and their participation in a share, including their identity, acceptance status, permissions, and role.
    ///
    /// The acceptance status determines the participant’s visibilty of the shared records. Statuses are: `pending`, `accepted`, `removed`, and `unknown`. If the status is `pending`, use [`CKAcceptSharesOperation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/ckacceptsharesoperation) to accept the share. Upon acceptance, CloudKit makes the shared records available in the participant’s shared database. The records remain accessible for as long as the participant’s status is `accepted`.
    ///
    /// You don’t create participants. Use the share’s [`participants`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/ckshare/participants) property to access its existing participants. Use [`UICloudSharingController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicloudsharingcontroller) to manage the share’s participants and their permissions. Alternatively, you can generate participants using [`CKFetchShareParticipantsOperation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/ckfetchshareparticipantsoperation). Participants must have an active iCloud account.
    ///
    /// Anyone with the URL of a public share can become a participant in that share. Participants of a public share assume the `publicUser` role. For private shares, the owner manages the participants. An owner is any participant with the `owner` role. A participant of a private share can’t accept the share unless the owner adds them first. Private share participants assume the `privateUser` role. CloudKit removes any pending participants if the owner changes the share’s [`publicPermission`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/ckshare/publicpermission). CloudKit removes all participants if the new permission is `none`.
    ///
    /// Participants with write permissions can modify or delete any record that you include in the share. However, only the owner can delete a shared hierarchy’s root record. If a participant attempts to delete the share, CloudKit removes the participant. The share remains active for all other participants.
