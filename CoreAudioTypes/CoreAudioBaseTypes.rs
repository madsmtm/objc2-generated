///
/// ## Overview
///
/// You can configure an audio stream basic description (ASBD) to specify a linear PCM format or a constant bit rate (CBR) format that has channels of equal size. For variable bit rate (VBR) audio, and for CBR audio where the channels have unequal sizes, also use an [`AudioStreamPacketDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreaudiotypes/audiostreampacketdescription) structure to additionally describe each packet.
///
/// A field value of `0` indicates that the value is either unknown or not applicable to the format.
///
/// Always initialize the fields of a new audio stream basic description structure to `0`, as the example below shows:
///
/// ```objc
/// AudioStreamBasicDescription myAudioDataFormat = {0};
/// ```
///
/// To determine the duration that one packet represents, use the [`mSampleRate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreaudiotypes/audiostreambasicdescription/msamplerate) field with the [`mFramesPerPacket`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreaudiotypes/audiostreambasicdescription/mframesperpacket) field, as follows:
///
/// ```objc
/// duration = (1 / mSampleRate) * mFramesPerPacket
/// ```
///
/// In Core Audio, the following definitions apply:
///
/// - An _audio stream_ is a continuous series of data that represents a sound, such as a song.
///
/// - A _channel_ is a discrete track of monophonic audio. A monophonic stream has one channel; a stereo stream has two channels.
///
/// - A _sample_ is single numerical value for a single audio channel in an audio stream.
///
/// - A _frame_ is a collection of time-coincident samples. For instance, a linear PCM stereo sound file has two samples per frame, one for the left channel and one for the right channel.
///
/// - A _packet_ is a collection of one or more contiguous frames. A packet defines the smallest meaningful set of frames for a given audio data format, and is the smallest data unit for which time can be measured. In linear PCM audio, a packet holds a single frame. In compressed formats, it typically holds more frames. In some formats, the number of frames per packet varies.
///
/// - The _sample rate_ for a stream is the number of frames per second of uncompressed audio, or, for compressed formats, the equivalent in decompressed audio.
///
///
/// This structure encapsulates all the information for describing the basic
/// format properties of a stream of audio data.
///
/// This structure is sufficient to describe any constant bit rate format that  has
/// channels that are the same size. Extensions are required for variable bit rate
/// data and for constant bit rate data where the channels have unequal sizes.
/// However, where applicable, the appropriate fields will be filled out correctly
/// for these kinds of formats (the extra data is provided via separate properties).
/// In all fields, a value of 0 indicates that the field is either unknown, not
/// applicable or otherwise is inapproprate for the format and should be ignored.
/// Note that 0 is still a valid value for most formats in the mFormatFlags field.
///
/// In audio data a frame is one sample across all channels. In non-interleaved
/// audio, the per frame fields identify one channel. In interleaved audio, the per
/// frame fields identify the set of n channels. In uncompressed audio, a Packet is
/// one frame, (mFramesPerPacket == 1). In compressed audio, a Packet is an
/// indivisible chunk of compressed data, for example an AAC packet will contain
/// 1024 sample frames.
///
///
/// The number of sample frames per second of the data in the stream.
///
/// The AudioFormatID indicating the general kind of data in the stream.
///
/// The AudioFormatFlags for the format indicated by mFormatID.
///
/// The number of bytes in a packet of data.
///
/// The number of sample frames in each packet of data.
///
/// The number of bytes in a single sample frame of data.
///
/// The number of channels in each frame of data.
///
/// The number of bits of sample data for each channel in a frame of data.
///
/// Pads the structure out to force an even 8 byte alignment.

/// A structure that defines an SMPTE time value.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, pronounced “SIMPtee”) times are used to correlate a point in an audio stream with an external event. For example, a SMPTE time can be used to correlate a sound in an audio file with a video frame in a movie file.
///
/// Note that the frames referred to by this structure are video frames, where a video frame is a single complete image. (Compare with the definition of audio frames in the discussion for [`AudioStreamBasicDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreaudiotypes/audiostreambasicdescription).)
///
/// A complete SMPTE time description takes 80 bits, including 32 user bits that contain vendor-specific information. The actual time-code portion of the SMPTE time description is normally sent in several messages, each message containing a portion of the time code. (The user bits are sent in a separate message.) Typically, the SMPTE time description is divided up into 8 1-byte messages, with the first nibble of each message specifying which portion of the time code is contained in the message and the second nibble containing the time information. Four such messages are normally sent with each video frame.
///
/// Video data contains somewhere from 24 to 60 frames per second (as specified by the SMPTE time type—see `SMPTE Timecode Types`) and each video frame has an associated SMPTE time. SMPTE time is based on a 24-hour clock. Each frame’s SMPTE time consists of an hour, minute, and second value, plus the number of the frame within the second. Because audio data is sampled at a much higher rate (MP3 data is sampled at over 100,000 bits per second, for example), it is frequently desirable to correlate the audio data with a time within the persistence period of a single video frame. For this reason, the time period during which a single video frame is displayed is subdivided into subframes (typically 80 or 100 subframes per frame, as specified by the `mSubFrameDivisor` field). The `mSubFrames` field specifies the number of subframes into the video frame represented by this time structure.
