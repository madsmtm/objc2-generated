    /// You create instances of this class by calling [`newSpatialScalerWithDevice:compiler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalfx/mtlfxspatialscalerdescriptor/makespatialscaler(device:compiler:)).
    ///
    /// When using instances of objects conforming to this protocol, you configure the different properties it inherits from protocol [`MTLFXSpatialScalerBase`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalfx/mtlfxspatialscalerbase) and then call [`encodeToCommandBuffer:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalfx/mtl4fxspatialscaler/encode(commandbuffer:)) to encode its work into a Metal command buffer.
