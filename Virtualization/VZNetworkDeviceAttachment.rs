    /// Don’t create a [`VZNetworkDeviceAttachment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vznetworkdeviceattachment) object directly. Instead, instantiate one of its concrete subclasses and use that object to configure your network devices. Each concrete subclass represents a specific type of network interface on the host computer.
