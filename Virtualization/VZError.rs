/// Errors you might encounter when configuring or using a virtual machine.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// The domain for these errors is [`VZErrorDomain`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzerrordomain). When an error originates in a different component, the [`NSError`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nserror) object contains the domain of that component.
///
///
/// Error type returned by the Virtualization framework.
/// The NSError domain is VZErrorDomain, the code is one of the VZErrorCode constants.
///
/// The virtualization framework can also report errors from other domains when the error originates from a lower level component.
///
///
/// Internal error such as the virtual machine unexpectedly stopping.
///
/// Invalid machine configuration.
///
/// API used with a machine in the wrong state (e.g. interacting with a machine before it is running).
///
/// Invalid change of state (e.g. pausing a virtual machine that is not started).
///
/// Unrecognized disk image format or invalid disk image.
///
/// The running virtual machine limit was exceeded.
///
/// Network error occurred.
///
/// Machine ran out of disk space.
///
/// The operation was cancelled.
///
/// The operation is not supported.
///
/// The save operation failed.
///
/// The restore operation failed.
///
/// The restore image catalog failed to load.
///
/// The restore image catalog is invalid.
///
/// The restore image catalog has no supported restore images.
///
/// The restore image failed to load.
///
/// The restore image is invalid.
///
/// A software update is required to complete the installation.
///
/// An error occurred during installation.
///
/// The connection or the negotiation with the NBD server failed.
///
/// The NBD client is disconnected from the server.
///
/// Controller not found.
///
/// Device is already attached.
///
/// Device initialization failure.
///
/// Device not found.
