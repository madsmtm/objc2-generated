    /// Use this configuration to attach a Mac keyboard configuration to a VM. A [`VZVirtualMachineView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtualmachineview) can use this device to send key events to the VM, including the Mac-specific key events, such as the Globe key.

    /// This device can be used by VZVirtualMachineView to send keyboard events to the virtual machine.
    /// This keyboard supports Apple-specific features such as the globe key.
    /// Note: this device is only recognized by virtual machines running macOS 13.0 and later. In order to support both macOS 13.0 and earlier
    /// guests, VZVirtualMachineConfiguration.keyboards can be set to an array containing both a VZMacKeyboardConfiguration and
    /// a VZUSBKeyboardConfiguration object. macOS 13.0 and later guests will use the Mac keyboard device,
    /// while earlier versions of macOS will use the USB keyboard device.
