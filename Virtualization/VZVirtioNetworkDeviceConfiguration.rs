    ///
    /// Use a [`VZVirtioNetworkDeviceConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtionetworkdeviceconfiguration) object to configure one network interface of your virtual machine. After creating this object, assign an appropriate value to its inherited [`attachment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vznetworkdeviceconfiguration/attachment) property to define the type of network interface you want. You can also assign a specific MAC address, or let the system generate a random address for you.
