    /// Use a [`VZFileHandleSerialPortAttachment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzfilehandleserialportattachment) object to configure a serial port using separate file handles for reading and writing data. In your virtual machine, use the file handles in this object in the following way:
    ///
    /// - To send data to the guest operating system, write data to the file handle in the [`fileHandleForReading`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzfilehandleserialportattachment/filehandleforreading) property.
    ///
    /// - To receive data from the guest operating system, read data from the file handle in the [`fileHandleForWriting`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzfilehandleserialportattachment/filehandleforwriting) property.
    ///
    ///
    /// File handle serial port attachment.
    ///
    /// VZFileHandleSerialPortAttachment defines a serial port attachment from a file handle.
    /// Data written to fileHandleForReading goes to the guest. Data sent from the guest appears on fileHandleForWriting.
