    /// Storage device attachment backed by a Network Block Device (NBD) client.
    ///
    /// This storage device attachment provides an NBD client implementation. The NBD client is connected
    /// to an NBD server referred to by an NBD Uniform Resource Indicator (URI), represented as an URL in
    /// this API. The NBD server runs outside of Virtualization framework and is not controlled by
    /// Virtualization framework. The NBD client forwards the guest's I/O operations to the NBD server,
    /// where the I/O operations are handled.
    ///
    /// The NBD client will attempt to connect to the NBD server referred to by the URL when you start the virtual
    /// machine (e.g. when `[VZVirtualMachine startWithCompletionHandler:]` is called). A connection attempt is NOT
    /// made when the attachment object is initialized. Reconnection attempts will take place throughout the life
    /// cycle of the virtual machine when the NBD client encounters a recoverable error such as connection timeout
    /// and unexpected connection errors. The NBD client will disconnect from the server when the virtual machine
    /// shuts down.
    ///
    /// Using this attachment requires the app to have the "com.apple.security.network.client" entitlement as this attachment opens an outgoing
    /// network connection.
    ///
    /// For more information about NBD, see https://github.com/NetworkBlockDevice/nbd/blob/master/doc/proto.md.
    /// For more information about the NBD URL format, see https://github.com/NetworkBlockDevice/nbd/blob/master/doc/uri.md.
    ///
    /// An example use of this API is:
    /// ```text
    /// NSURL *url = [[NSURL alloc] initWithString:
    /// "
    /// nbd://localhost:10809/myDisk"]
    /// NSError *error = nil;
