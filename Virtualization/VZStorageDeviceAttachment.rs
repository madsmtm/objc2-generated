    /// A [`VZStorageDeviceAttachment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzstoragedeviceattachment) object defines the implementation of a storage interface in a virtual machine. You use the attachment object to specify the source of the storage on the host computer.
    ///
    /// Don’t create [`VZStorageDeviceAttachment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzstoragedeviceattachment) objects directly. Instead, instantiate an appropriate subclass such as [`VZDiskImageStorageDeviceAttachment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzdiskimagestoragedeviceattachment), which provides storage using a disk image.
