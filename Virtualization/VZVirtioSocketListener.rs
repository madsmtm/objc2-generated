    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Use a [`VZVirtioSocketListener`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiosocketlistener) object to route connection requests to your associated delegate object. The socket listener object handles incoming connection requests from the guest operating system and directs them to the methods of its associated [`delegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiosocketlistener/delegate) object. You may use the same listener object to monitor connections on multiple ports.
    ///
    /// After creating a [`VZVirtioSocketListener`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiosocketlistener) object, assign a custom object to its [`delegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiosocketlistener/delegate) property. The delegate must implement the [`VZVirtioSocketListenerDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiosocketlistenerdelegate) protocol. To connect the listener to a port, call the [`setSocketListener:forPort:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiosocketdevice/setsocketlistener(_:forport:)) method of your virtual machine’s [`VZVirtioSocketDevice`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiosocketdevice) object.
