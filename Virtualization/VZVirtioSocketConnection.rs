    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// A [`VZVirtioSocketConnection`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiosocketconnection) object contains the port information for the guest operating system and host computer. You don’t create connection objects directly. When the guest operating system initiates a connection, the virtual machine creates the connection object and passes it to the appropriate [`VZVirtioSocketListener`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiosocketlistener) object, which forwards the object to its delegate. When the virtual machine opens a connection to a guest port, the [`connectToPort:completionHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiosocketdevice/connect(toport:)) method (Objective-C) or [`connect(toPort:completionHandler:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiosocketdevice/connect(toport:completionhandler:)) method (Swift) pass the connection object to your completion handler.
