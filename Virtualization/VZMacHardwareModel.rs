    /// The Mac hardware model abstracts a set of virtualized hardware elements and configurations.
    /// A version of macOS may only run on certain hardware models. The host may also only provide certain hardware models
    /// based on the version of macOS and the underlying hardware.
    /// Use VZMacHardwareModel.supported to know if a hardware model is supported on the current host.
    ///
    /// Choosing the hardware model starts from a restore image with VZMacOSRestoreImage.
    /// A restore image describes its supported configuration requirements through VZMacOSRestoreImage.mostFeaturefulSupportedConfiguration.
    /// A configuration requirements object has a corresponding hardware model that can be used to configure a virtual machine
    /// that meets the requirements.
    ///
    /// Once the hardware model is obtained, use VZMacPlatformConfiguration.hardwareModel to configure the Mac platform,
    /// and -[VZMacAuxiliaryStorage initCreatingStorageAtURL:hardwareModel:options:error:] to create its auxiliary storage.
    /// Once the virtual machine is created, use VZMacOSInstaller to install macOS on it.
    ///
    /// If the virtual machine is preserved on disk, the hardware model used for installation should be preserved for subsequent boots.
    /// The VZMacHardwareModel.dataRepresentation property provides a unique binary representation that can be serialized.
    /// The hardware model then can be recreated from the binary representation with -[VZMacHardwareModel initWithDataRepresentation:].
