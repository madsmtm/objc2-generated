    /// A network device that interacts directly with a physical network interface on the host computer.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// A [`VZBridgedNetworkDeviceAttachment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzbridgednetworkdeviceattachment) object represents a physical interface on the host computer. Use this object when configuring a network interface for your virtual machine. A bridged network device sends and receives packets on the same physical interface as the host computer, but does so using a different network layer.
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Important
    ///  To use this attachment, your app must have the [`com.apple.vm.networking`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.vm.networking) entitlement. If it doesn’t, the use of this attachment point results in an invalid [`VZVirtualMachineConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtualmachineconfiguration) object.
    ///

    ///
    /// </div>
    /// To configure a network device with a bridged network interface:
    ///
    /// 1. Obtain a reference to one of the host’s physical network interfaces from the [`networkInterfaces`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzbridgednetworkinterface/networkinterfaces) property of [`VZBridgedNetworkInterface`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzbridgednetworkinterface).
    ///
    /// 2. Create the [`VZBridgedNetworkDeviceAttachment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzbridgednetworkdeviceattachment) object using the network interface.
    ///
    /// 3. Assign the attachment object to the [`attachment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vznetworkdeviceconfiguration/attachment) property of a [`VZVirtioNetworkDeviceConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtionetworkdeviceconfiguration) object.
    ///
    /// 4. Add the [`VZVirtioNetworkDeviceConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtionetworkdeviceconfiguration) object to the [`networkDevices`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtualmachineconfiguration/networkdevices) property of your [`VZVirtualMachineConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtualmachineconfiguration).
