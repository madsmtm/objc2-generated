    /// A class that represents a USB controller in a VM.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Don’t create a `VZUSBController` directly. You need to first configure USB controllers on a [`VZVirtualMachineConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtualmachineconfiguration) through a subclass of [`VZUSBControllerConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzusbcontrollerconfiguration). When you create a [`VZVirtualMachine`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtualmachine) from the configuration, the USB controllers are available through the [`usbControllers`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtualmachine/usbcontrollers) property.
    ///
    /// The concrete type of a `VZUSBController` corresponds to the type the configuration uses. For example, a [`VZXHCIControllerConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzxhcicontrollerconfiguration) leads to a device of type [`VZXHCIController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzxhcicontroller).

    /// Class representing a USB controller in a virtual machine.

    /// VZUSBController should not be instantiated directly.
    /// USB controllers are first configured on the VZVirtualMachineConfiguration through a subclass of VZUSBControllerConfiguration.
    /// When a VZVirtualMachine is created from the configuration, the USB controllers are available through the VZVirtualMachine.usbControllers property.
    /// The real type of VZUSBController corresponds to the type used by the configuration.
    /// For example, a VZXHCIControllerConfiguration leads to a device of type VZXHCIController.
