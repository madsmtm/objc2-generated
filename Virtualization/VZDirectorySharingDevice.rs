    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Don’t instantiate `VZDirectorySharingDevice` directly; configure a directory sharing device first by using [`VZVirtualMachineConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtualmachineconfiguration) through a subclass of [`VZDirectorySharingDeviceConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzdirectorysharingdeviceconfiguration).
    ///
    /// When you create a [`VZVirtualMachine`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtualmachine) from the configuration, the directory sharing devices are available through the `VZVirtualMachine.directorySharingDevices` property.
    ///
    /// The real type of `VZDirectorySharingDevice` corresponds to the type used by the configuration. For example, a [`VZVirtioFileSystemDeviceConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiofilesystemdeviceconfiguration) leads to a device of type [`VZVirtioFileSystemDevice`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiofilesystemdevice).
