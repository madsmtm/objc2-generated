    /// The object you use to change the amount of memory allocated to the guest system.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// A [`VZVirtioTraditionalMemoryBalloonDevice`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiotraditionalmemoryballoondevice) object implements a Virtio-compliant balloon memory device, which lets you change the amount of physical memory assigned to the guest operating system. The virtual machine has no insight into the amount of memory its guest operating system uses. A memory balloon device lets you ask the guest operating system to relinquish memory voluntarily, which you might do if memory resources become scarce.
    ///
    /// You don’t create a [`VZVirtioTraditionalMemoryBalloonDevice`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiotraditionalmemoryballoondevice) object directly. Instead, create a [`VZVirtioTraditionalMemoryBalloonDeviceConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiotraditionalmemoryballoondeviceconfiguration) object and assign it to the [`memoryBalloonDevices`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtualmachineconfiguration/memoryballoondevices) property of your virtual machine configuration. In response, the virtual machine creates this object and assigns it to its [`memoryBalloonDevices`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtualmachine/memoryballoondevices) property.
    ///
    /// To use a memory balloon device, change the value in the [`targetVirtualMachineMemorySize`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vzvirtiotraditionalmemoryballoondevice/targetvirtualmachinememorysize) property when your virtual machine is running. If the new value is smaller than the amount of currently assigned memory, the guest system may return a list of unused memory pages using the memory balloon device. If it does, the virtual machine releases those pages back to the host computer. If it doesn’t return any memory pages, the virtual machine leaves the guest’s memory size unchanged. If the new value is larger than the amount of currently assigned memory, the virtual machine reserves more pages for the guest operating system.
    ///
    /// For optimal performance, the guest operating system should compact its memory before returning any pages back to the memory balloon device. Compacting the memory reduces fragmentation, and allows it to return contiguous blocks of free pages in the memory balloon device.
    ///
    ///
    /// Virtio Traditional Memory Balloon Device
    ///
    /// This is a primitive device for managing guest memory.
    /// This device enables memory transfer between the host and the guest as specified by the Virtio specification, which allows the guest to adapt changes
    /// in allowance of underlying physical memory.
    ///
    /// To request a memory balloon device operation for the memory transfer, write the targeted memory size for the virtual machine to the targetVirtualMachineMemorySize property.
    /// When the value written to targetVirtualMachineMemorySize is less than the current value, memory will be taken away from the guest and given to the host by the amount
    /// determined by the difference between those two values. Similarly, when the value written to targetVirtualMachineMemorySize is greater than the current value, memory will be
    /// given back to the guest by the amount determined by the difference between those two values.
    ///
    /// Note that any changes to targetVirtualMachineMemorySize is a request to trigger a memory balloon operation. The actual changes in memory only happen after the guest operating
    /// system handles the request, if at all.
    ///
    /// The targetVirtualMachineMemorySize property is initialized to VZVirtualMachineConfiguration.memorySize. The acceptable values for the targetVirtualMachineMemorySize
    /// property range from VZVirtualMachineConfiguration.minimumAllowedMemorySize to VZVirtualMachineConfiguration.memorySize, and must be a multiple of 1 megabyte
    /// (1024 * 1024 bytes). If those constraints aren't satisfied, targetVirtualMachineMemorySize will be rounded down to the nearest multiple of 1 megabyte, clamped to
    /// VZVirtualMachineConfiguration.minimumAllowedMemorySize and VZVirtualMachineConfiguration.memorySize respectively.
    ///
    /// For optimal performance, it is strongly recommended to perform a memory compaction operation in the guest (e.g. echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory) before invoking the device.
    /// This helps to minimize memory fragmentation in order for the memory allocation/deallocation process to be more effective.
    ///
    /// This device is created through instantiating a VZVirtioTraditionalMemoryBalloonDeviceConfiguration in a VZVirtualMachineConfiguration and is available in the
    /// VZVirtualMachine.memoryBalloonDevices property.
