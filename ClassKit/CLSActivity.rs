    /// A representation of user interaction with a context.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// An activity represents a student’s attempt to complete the task corresponding to a [`CLSContext`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/classkit/clscontext) instance. For example, if a context represents a quiz, the associated activity represents the student’s attempt to take the quiz. As such, an activity is always associated with a context. In fact, you never initialize an activity in isolation or store a reference to it. Rather, you ask a context to create the activity and retrieve it from the context.
    ///
    /// ### Starting and Stopping Activities
    ///
    /// You start the activity with a call to the [`start`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/classkit/clsactivity/start()) method when the user begins the task, and stop it with a call to the [`stop`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/classkit/clsactivity/stop()) method when the user finishes. You can also use the [`stop`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/classkit/clsactivity/stop()) method to stop it temporarily if the user pauses the task, in which case you can start it again later with another call to [`start`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/classkit/clsactivity/start()) when the user resumes. The activity keeps track of the total time spent in the running state, which you can read via the [`duration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/classkit/clsactivity/duration) property.
    ///
    /// Whether you implement activity pausing depends on how the parts of your app work. For example, you might pause a game activity when the user presses the pause button to reflect that the user has stepped away from the activity, but is likely to return soon to complete the task. On the other hand, you might not provide a way to pause a quiz activity because you require that it be completed without interruption, once started. If you do pause, you can start and stop an activity as many times as you want, but when you create a new activity (representing a new attempt at a task), you can no longer access the older activity from your app.
    ///
    /// ### Recording Progress
    ///
    /// You can also assign [`progress`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/classkit/clsactivity/progress) to an activity. How you define progress depends on the task being measured. For example, progress through a quiz can be recorded as the fraction of questions answered, while progress through a game level might be calculated as the fraction of obstacles overcome.
    ///
    /// To record additional metrics, you attach [`CLSActivityItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/classkit/clsactivityitem) instances to an activity. For example, you can add both a score and a count of hints used to a quiz activity. If one of these items should be featured prominently, you can make it the [`primaryActivityItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/classkit/clsactivity/primaryactivityitem).
    ///
    ///
    /// CLSActivity represents user generated activity data for a given context.
    ///
    /// CLSActivity has three major components.
    ///
    /// (1) Progress, used to measure the amount of activity a user generates as a percentage.
    /// (2) Duration, used to measure the length of time a user spent on this activity. Use
    /// `-start`and
    /// `-stop`methods.
    /// (3) Activity Items, used to gather information about the activity generated by a user.
