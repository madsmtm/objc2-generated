    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Instances of the [`CBUUID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbuuid) class represent the 128-bit universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) of attributes used in Bluetooth low energy communication, such as a peripheral’s services, characteristics, and descriptors. This class provides a number of factory methods for dealing with long UUIDs when developing your app. For example, instead of passing around the string representation of a 128-bit Bluetooth low energy attribute in your code, you can create a [`CBUUID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbuuid) object that represents it, and pass that around instead.
    ///
    /// The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) publishes a list of commonly-used UUIDs, many of which are 16- or 32-bits for convenience. The [`CBUUID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbuuid) class provides methods that automatically transform these predefined shorter UUIDs into their 128-bit equivalent UUIDs. When you create a [`CBUUID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbuuid) object from a predefined 16- or 32-bit UUID, Core Bluetooth pre-fills the rest of the 128-bit UUID with the Bluetooth base UUID, as defined in the Bluetooth 4.0 specification, Volume 3, Part F, Section 3.2.1.
    ///
    /// In addition to providing methods for creating [`CBUUID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbuuid) objects, this class defines constants that represent the UUIDs of the Bluetooth-defined characteristic descriptors, as defined in the Bluetooth 4.0 specification, Volume 3, Part G, Section 3.3.3.
    ///
    ///
    /// A 16-bit, 32-bit, or 128-bit Bluetooth UUID.
    /// 16-bit and 32-bit UUIDs are implicitly pre-filled with the Bluetooth Base UUID.
