    /// The [`CBCentral`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbcentral) class represents remote central devices (or _centrals_) that have connected to an app implementing the peripheral role on a local device. Remote centrals use universally unique identifiers (UUIDs), represented by [`NSUUID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuuid) objects, to identify themselves.
