    /// A request that deletes objects in the SQLite persistent store without loading them into memory.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// `NSBatchDeleteRequest` — available only when using a SQLite persistent store — deletes managed objects at the SQL level of the persistent store. This request is quicker and more efficient than using a context to fetch a large number of objects into memory, delete them, and then save those deletions back to the store. You create a request using an instance of [`NSFetchRequest`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsfetchrequest) that identifies the objects to delete. Alternatively, you can provide an array of identifiers from specific objects of the same entity type; mixing entity types results in an error when you execute the request.
    ///
    /// [`NSManagedObjectContext`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsmanagedobjectcontext) doesn’t automatically merge a request’s deletions because they happen at the SQL level. Subsequently, you must remove any deleted objects from memory after the request finishes. To determine the objects a request deletes, configure it to return the [`NSManagedObjectID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsmanagedobjectid) of each deleted object and use those identifiers to update your contexts, as the following example shows:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // Configure the request to return the IDs of the objects it deletes.
    /// request.resultType = .resultTypeObjectIDs
    ///
    /// do {
    ///     // Execute the request.
    ///     let deleteResult = try context.execute(request) as? NSBatchDeleteResult
    ///     
    ///     // Extract the IDs of the deleted managed objectss from the request's result.
    ///     if let objectIDs = deleteResult?.result as? [NSManagedObjectID] {
    ///         
    ///         // Merge the deletions into the app's managed object context.
    ///         NSManagedObjectContext.mergeChanges(
    ///             fromRemoteContextSave: [NSDeletedObjectsKey: objectIDs],
    ///             into: [context]
    ///         )
    ///     }
    /// } catch {
    ///     // Handle any thrown errors.
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Alternatively, you can use persistent history tracking to make your contexts aware of changes that happen at the persistent store level. For more information, see [Consuming relevant store changes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/consuming-relevant-store-changes).
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Important
    ///  Ensure that a request’s changes don’t violate the validation rules in your data model beyond basic delete rules, such as reducing a relationship count below the specified minimum. The Deny delete rule isn’t compatible with `NSBatchDeleteRequest`.
