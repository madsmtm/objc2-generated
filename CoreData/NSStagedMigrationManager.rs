    /// An object that handles the migration event loop and provides access to the migrating persistent store.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// A staged migration manager contains the individual stages of a migration and applies those stages, in the order you specify, when that migration runs. The manager handles the migration’s event loop, and provides access to the migrating store through its [`container`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsstagedmigrationmanager/container) property. Stages can be custom, which enables you to perform tasks immediately before and after a stage runs, or lightweight, which supplements custom stages with those that Core Data can invoke automatically because they’re already compatible with lightweight migrations.
    ///
    /// Use [`NSPersistentStoreStagedMigrationManagerOptionKey`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nspersistentstorestagedmigrationmanageroptionkey) to include an instance of [`NSStagedMigrationManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsstagedmigrationmanager) in your persistent store’s options dictionary, as the following example shows:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // Create a migration manager with the required stages.
    /// let manager = NSStagedMigrationManager(stages)
    ///
    /// let options = [
    ///     // Enable lightweight migrations for this store.
    ///     NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption: true,
    ///     NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOption: true
    ///     // Specify the migration manager to use with this store.
    ///     NSPersistentStoreStagedMigrationManagerOptionKey: manager
    /// ]
    ///
    /// // Add the store to the persistent store coordinator.        
    /// let store = coordinator.addPersistentStore(
    ///     type: .sqlite,
    ///     at: storeURL,
    ///     options: options
    /// )
    /// ```
