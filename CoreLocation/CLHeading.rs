    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// A [`CLHeading`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clheading) object contains computed values for the device’s azimuth (orientation) relative to true or magnetic north. It also includes the raw data for the three-dimensional vector used to compute those values. A navigation app might use the information to rotate a map so that it reflects the direction that the user is facing.
    ///
    /// Typically, you don’t create instances of this class yourself, nor do you subclass it. Instead, you receive instances of this class through the delegate assigned to the [`CLLocationManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager) object whose [`startUpdatingHeading`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/startupdatingheading()) method you called.
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Note
    ///  If you want heading objects to contain valid data for the [`trueHeading`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clheading/trueheading) property, configure your location manager object to deliver location updates. You can start the delivery of these updates by calling the location manager object’s [`startUpdatingLocation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/startupdatinglocation()) method.
