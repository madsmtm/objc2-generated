    ///

    ///
    /// - Report heading changes from the onboard compass.

    /// Create one or more location-manager objects in your app and use them where you need location data. After you create a location-manager object, configure it so that Core Location knows how often to report location changes. In particular, configure the [`distanceFilter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/distancefilter) and [`desiredAccuracy`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/desiredaccuracy) properties with values that reflect your app’s needs.

    /// A [`CLLocationManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager) object reports all location-related updates to its [`delegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/delegate) object, which is an object that conforms to the [`CLLocationManagerDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanagerdelegate) protocol. Assign the delegate immediately when you configure your location manager, because the system reports the app’s authorization status to the delegate’s [`locationManagerDidChangeAuthorization:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanagerdelegate/locationmanagerdidchangeauthorization(_:)) method after the location manager finishes initializing itself.  Core Location calls the methods of your delegate object using the [`NSRunLoop`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/runloop) of the thread on which you initialized the [`CLLocationManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager) object. That thread must itself have an active [`NSRunLoop`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/runloop), like the one found in your app’s main thread.
