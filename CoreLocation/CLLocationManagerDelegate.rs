    /// The methods you use to receive events from an associated location-manager object.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The location manager calls its delegate’s methods to report location-related events to your app. Implement this protocol in an app-specific object and use the methods to update your app. For example, you might use the current location to update the user’s position on a map or you might return search results relevant only to the user’s current location.
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Important
    ///  Always implement the methods for handling any potential failures in addition to the methods for receiving location-related data.
    ///
    ///
    ///
    /// </div>
    /// Assign your delegate object to the [`delegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/delegate) property of the [`CLLocationManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager) object before starting any services. Core Location may report a cached value to your delegate immediately after you start the service, followed by a more current value later. Check the time stamp of any data objects you receive before using them.
    ///
    /// Core Location calls the methods of your delegate object on the runloop from the thread on which you initialized [`CLLocationManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager). That thread must itself have an active run loop, like the one found in your app’s main thread.
