/// Use to access resources within the app bundle.
///
/// ## Discussion
///
/// A _bundle_ is a directory with a standardized hierarchical structure that holds executable code and the resources used by that code. Bundles organize their contained resources into well-defined subdirectories.
///
/// By using a bundle object, you can access a bundle’s resources without knowing the structure of the bundle. The bundle object provides a single interface for locating items, taking into account the bundle structure, user preferences, available localizations, and other relevant factors.
