    /// An anchor that tracks the position and movement of a human body in the rear-facing camera.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// This [`ARAnchor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/aranchor) subclass tracks the movement of a single person. You enable body tracking by running your session using [`ARBodyTrackingConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arbodytrackingconfiguration).
    ///
    /// When ARKit recognizes a person in the back camera feed, it calls your delegate’s [`session:didAddAnchors:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arsessiondelegate/session(_:didadd:)) function with [`ARBodyAnchor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arbodyanchor). A body anchor’s [`transform`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/aranchor/transform) position defines the world position of the body’s hip joint.
    ///
    /// You can also check within the frame’s [`anchors`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arframe/anchors) for a body that ARKit is tracking.
    ///
    /// ### Place a Skeleton on a Surface
    ///
    /// Because a body anchor’s origin maps to the hip joint, you calculate the current offset of the feet to the hip to place the body’s skeleton on a surface. By passing the foot joint index to [`jointModelTransforms`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arskeleton3d/jointmodeltransforms-dno4), you get the foot’s offset from skeleton’s origin.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// static var hipToFootOffset: Float {
    ///     // Get an index for a foot.
    ///     let footIndex = ARSkeletonDefinition.defaultBody3D.index(forJointName: .leftFoot)
    ///     // Get the foot's world-space offset from the hip.
    ///     let footTransform = ARSkeletonDefinition.defaultBody3D.neutralBodySkeleton3D!.jointModelTransforms[footIndex]
    ///     // Return the height by getting just the y-value.
    ///     let distanceFromHipOnY = abs(footTransform.columns.3.y)
    ///     return distanceFromHipOnY
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    ///
    /// An anchor representing a body in the world.
