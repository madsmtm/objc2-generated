    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// This object contains the following depth information that the LiDAR scanner captures at runtime:
    ///
    /// - Every pixel in the [`depthMap`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/ardepthdata/depthmap) maps to a region of the visible scene ([`capturedImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arframe/capturedimage)), where the pixel value defines that region’s distance from the plane of the camera in meters.
    ///
    /// - The [`confidenceMap`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/ardepthdata/confidencemap) property measures the accuracy of the corresponding depth data in [`depthMap`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/ardepthdata/depthmap), and is useful in filtering out lower-accuracy depth values if an app’s algorithm required it.
    ///
    /// [`ARWorldTrackingConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arworldtrackingconfiguration) exposes this depth information in the [`sceneDepth`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arframe/scenedepth) property which it updates every frame. To enable scene depth, add the [`ARFrameSemanticSceneDepth`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arconfiguration/framesemantics-swift.struct/scenedepth) frame semantic to a world-tracking configuration’s [`frameSemantics`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arconfiguration/framesemantics-swift.property) and frames vended by the session contain [`ARDepthData`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/ardepthdata) captured by the LiDAR scanner.
