    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// When you run a world-tracking AR session and specify [`ARReferenceImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arreferenceimage) objects for the session configuration’s [`detectionImages`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arworldtrackingconfiguration/detectionimages) property, ARKit searches for those images in the real-world environment. When the session recognizes an image, it automatically adds an [`ARImageAnchor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arimageanchor) for each detected image to its list of anchors.
    ///
    /// To find the extent of a recognized image in the scene, use the inherited [`transform`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/aranchor/transform) property together with the [`physicalSize`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arreferenceimage/physicalsize) of the anchor’s [`referenceImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arimageanchor/referenceimage).
