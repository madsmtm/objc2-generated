    /// An object that provides environmental lighting information for a specific area of space in a world-tracking AR session.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Environment textures depict the view in all directions from a specific point in a scene. In 3D asset rendering, environment textures are the basis for image-based lighting algorithms where surfaces can realistically reflect light from their surroundings. ARKit can generate environment textures during an AR session using camera imagery, allowing SceneKit or a custom-rendering engine to provide realistic image-based lighting for virtual objects in your AR experience.
    ///
    /// To enable texture map generation for an AR session, set the [`environmentTexturing`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arworldtrackingconfiguration/environmenttexturing-swift.property) property:
    ///
    /// - With [`AREnvironmentTexturingManual`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arworldtrackingconfiguration/environmenttexturing-swift.enum/manual) environment texturing, you identify points in the scene for which you want light probe texture maps by creating [`AREnvironmentProbeAnchor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arenvironmentprobeanchor) objects and adding them to the session.
    ///
    /// - With [`AREnvironmentTexturingAutomatic`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arworldtrackingconfiguration/environmenttexturing-swift.enum/automatic) environment texturing, ARKit automatically creates, positions, and adds [`AREnvironmentProbeAnchor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arenvironmentprobeanchor) objects to the session.
    ///
    /// In both cases, ARKit automatically generates environment textures as the session collects camera imagery. Use a delegate method such as [`session:didUpdateAnchors:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arsessiondelegate/session(_:didupdate:)-3qtt8) to find out when a texture is available, and access it from the anchor’s [`environmentTexture`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arenvironmentprobeanchor/environmenttexture) property.
    ///
    /// If you display AR content using [`ARSCNView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arscnview) and the [`automaticallyUpdatesLighting`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arscnview/automaticallyupdateslighting) option, SceneKit automatically retrieves [`AREnvironmentProbeAnchor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arenvironmentprobeanchor) texture maps and uses them to light the scene.
