/// When you send [`ARCollaborationData`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arsession/collaborationdata) over the network by using a protocol that allows you to specify varying reliability, this property provides you with a hint about which reliability setting to use for a given collaboration data instance. Depending on its priority, you may also choose to send a given collaboration data instance using different protocols.
