    ///
    /// If you use [`ARView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/arview) or [`ARSCNView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arscnview) as your renderer, you can search for real-world surfaces at a screen point using the [`raycast(from:allowing:alignment:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/arview/raycast(from:allowing:alignment:)), and [`raycastQueryFromPoint:allowingTarget:alignment:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arscnview/raycastquery(from:allowing:alignment:)) functions, respectively.
    ///
    /// If you use a custom renderer, you can find real-world positions using screen points with:
    ///
    /// - The [`raycastQueryFromPoint:allowingTarget:alignment:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arframe/raycastquery(from:allowing:alignment:)) function of [`ARFrame`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arframe).
    ///
    /// - The [`raycast:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arsession/raycast(_:)) function of [`ARSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arsession).
    ///
    /// For tracked raycasting, you call [`trackedRaycast:updateHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arsession/trackedraycast(_:updatehandler:)) on your app’s current [`ARSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arsession).
