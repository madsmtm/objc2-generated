    /// ARKit subdivides the reconstructed, real-world scene surrounding the user into mesh anchors.

    /// Mesh anchors constantly update their data as ARKit refines its understanding of the real world. Although ARKit updates a mesh to reflect a change in the physical environment (such as when a person pulls out a chair), the mesh’s subsequent change is not intended to reflect in real time.
