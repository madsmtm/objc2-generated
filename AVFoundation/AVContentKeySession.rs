    /// Its secondary purpose is to provide a report of expired sessions to assist a controlling entity that wishes to track the set of sessions that are still active. If initialized with a location at which to store them, AVContentKeySession maintains a global collection of pending "expired session reports", each associated with an identifier for the app that created the session. The contents of this identifier are specified by the controlling entity that provides media data or that grants permission for its use.

    /// Expired sessions are tracked as follows: a stream processing session is considered to be started after an instance of AVContentKeySession is created and the first object conforming to the AVContentKeyRecipient protocol is added to it. If an instance of AVContentKeySession that has reached this state does not receive an expire message before it's deallocated or the process in which it's running is terminated, an "expired session report" will subsequently be added to the pending list of expired session reports that indicates that the session expired abnormally. In contrast, for AVContentKeySessions that reach the state of having at least one object conforming to the AVContentKeyRecipient protocol added to them and later receive an expire message, "expired session reports" will be generated that indicate that the session expired normally.
