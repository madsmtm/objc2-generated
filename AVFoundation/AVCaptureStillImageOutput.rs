        /// Parameter `handler`: A user provided block that will be called asynchronously as each still image in the bracket is captured. If the capture request is successful, the "sampleBuffer" parameter contains a valid CMSampleBuffer, the "stillImageSettings" parameter contains the settings object corresponding to this still image, and a nil "error" parameter. If the bracketed capture fails, sample buffer is NULL and error is non-nil. If [settings count] exceeds -maxBracketedCaptureStillImageCount, then AVErrorMaximumStillImageCaptureRequestsExceeded is returned. You should not assume that the completion handler will be called on a specific thread.
