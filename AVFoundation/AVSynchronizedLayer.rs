    /// A Core Animation layer that derives its timing from a player item so that you can synchronize layer animations with media playback.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// You can create an arbitrary number of synchronized layers from the same `AVPlayerItem` object.
    ///
    /// A synchronized layer is similar to a [`CATransformLayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/catransformlayer) object in that it doesn’t display anything itself, it just confers state upon its layer subtree. `AVSynchronizedLayer` confers its timing state, synchronizing the timing of layers in its subtree with that of a player item.
    ///
    /// Any `CoreAnimation` layer with animation property set that is added as a sublayer of `AVSynchronizedLayer` should set the animation’s [`beginTime`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/camediatiming/begintime) property to a non-zero positive value so animations will be interpreted on the player item’s timeline. `CoreAnimation` replaces the default `beginTime` of 0.0 with [`CACurrentMediaTime`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/cacurrentmediatime()). To start the animation from time 0, use a small positive value like [`AVCoreAnimationBeginTimeAtZero`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcoreanimationbegintimeatzero).
    ///
    /// You might use a layer as shown in the following example:
    ///
    /// ```objc
    /// AVPlayerItem *playerItem = <#Get a player item#>;
    /// CALayer *superLayer =  <#Get a layer#>;
    /// // Set up a synchronized layer to sync the layer timing of its subtree
    /// // with the playback of the playerItem/
    /// AVSynchronizedLayer *syncLayer = [AVSynchronizedLayer synchronizedLayerWithPlayerItem:playerItem];
    /// [syncLayer addSublayer:<#Another layer#>];    // These sublayers will be synchronized.
    /// [superLayer addSublayer:syncLayer];
    /// ```
