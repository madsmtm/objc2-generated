In order to project from the 2D image plane back into the 3D world, the images must be distortion corrected, or made rectilinear.

This model assumes radially symmetric lens distortion. When dealing with AVDepthData, the disparity / depth map representations are geometrically distorted to align with images produced by the camera.
