One of the constituent video devices is selected as the primary constituent device. For an AVCaptureSession, the primary constituent device produces for all outputs. For an AVCaptureMultiCamSession, the primary constituent device produces for all outputs connected to the virtual device's native AVCaptureDeviceInputPort (where its sourceDeviceType is equal to the virtual device's deviceType).
///
/// When the requested zoom factor can be achieved by multiple constituent cameras (see -virtualDeviceSwitchOverVideoZoomFactors), the virtual device chooses the best camera for the scene. The primary condition for this is the focal length; the camera with the longest focal length requires the least amount of digital upscaling and therefore normally provides the highest image quality. Secondary conditions are focus and exposure; when the scene requires focus or exposure to go beyond the limits of the active primary constituent device, a camera with a shorter focal length may be able to deliver a better quality image. Such a device is called a fallback primary constituent device. For example, a telephoto camera with a minimum focus distance of 40cm is not able to deliver a sharp image when the subject in the scene is closer than 40cm. For such a scene, the virtual device will switch to the wide-angle camera which typically has a smaller minimum focus distance and is able to achieve accurate focus on the subject. In this case the wide-angle camera is the fallback primary constitute device.

Use this as an alternative to setting ``exposurePointOfInterest``, as it allows you to specify both a location and size. For example, a value of `CGRectMake(0, 0, 1, 1)` tells the device to use the entire field of view when determining the exposure, while `CGRectMake(0, 0, 0.25, 0.25)` indicates the top left sixteenth, and `CGRectMake(0.75, 0.75, 0.25, 0.25)` indicates the bottom right sixteenth. Setting ``exposureRectOfInterest`` throws an `NSInvalidArgumentException` if ``exposureRectOfInterestSupported`` returns `false`. Setting ``exposureRectOfInterest`` throws an `NSInvalidArgumentException` if your provided rectangle's size is smaller than the ``minExposureRectOfInterestSize``. Setting ``exposureRectOfInterest`` throws an `NSGenericException` if you call it without first obtaining exclusive access to the device using ``AVCaptureDevice/lockForConfiguration:``. Setting ``exposureRectOfInterest`` updates the device's ``exposurePointOfInterest`` to the center of your provided rectangle of interest.

If you change your ``AVCaptureDevice/activeFormat``, the point of interest and rectangle of interest both revert to their default values. You can observe automatic changes to the device's ``exposureRectOfInterest`` by key-value observing this property.
