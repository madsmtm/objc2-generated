/// This struct is the value of the primeInfo property and specifies priming information.

/// When using convertToBuffer:error:withInputFromBlock: (either a single call or a series of calls), some
/// conversions, particularly involving sample-rate conversion, ideally require a certain
/// number of input frames previous to the normal start input frame and beyond the end of
/// the last expected input frame in order to yield high-quality results.
///
/// These are expressed in the leadingFrames and trailingFrames members of the structure.
///
/// The very first call to convertToBuffer:error:withInputFromBlock:, or first call after
/// reset, will request additional input frames beyond those normally
/// expected in the input proc callback to fulfill this first AudioConverterFillComplexBuffer()
/// request. The number of additional frames requested, depending on the prime method, will
/// be approximately:
///
/// Prime method                        | Additional frames
/// ------------------------------------|----------------------
/// AVAudioConverterPrimeMethod_Pre     | leadingFrames + trailingFrames
/// AVAudioConverterPrimeMethod_Normal  | trailingFrames
/// AVAudioConverterPrimeMethod_None    | 0
///
/// Thus, in effect, the first input proc callback(s) may provide not only the leading
/// frames, but also may "read ahead" by an additional number of trailing frames depending
/// on the prime method.
///
/// AVAudioConverterPrimeMethod_None is useful in a real-time application processing live input,
/// in which case trailingFrames (relative to input sample rate) of through latency will be
/// seen at the beginning of the output of the AudioConverter.  In other real-time
/// applications such as DAW systems, it may be possible to provide these initial extra
/// audio frames since they are stored on disk or in memory somewhere and
/// AVAudioConverterPrimeMethod_Pre may be preferable.  The default method is
/// AVAudioConverterPrimeMethod_Normal, which requires no pre-seeking of the input stream and
/// generates no latency at the output.
///
/// Field: leadingFrames
/// Specifies the number of leading (previous) input frames, relative to the normal/desired
/// start input frame, required by the converter to perform a high quality conversion. If
/// using AVAudioConverterPrimeMethod_Pre, the client should "pre-seek" the input stream provided
/// through the input proc by leadingFrames. If no frames are available previous to the
/// desired input start frame (because, for example, the desired start frame is at the very
/// beginning of available audio), then provide "leadingFrames" worth of initial zero frames
/// in the input proc.  Do not "pre-seek" in the default case of
/// AVAudioConverterPrimeMethod_Normal or when using AVAudioConverterPrimeMethod_None.
///
/// Field: trailingFrames
/// Specifies the number of trailing input frames (past the normal/expected end input frame)
/// required by the converter to perform a high quality conversion.  The client should be
/// prepared to provide this number of additional input frames except when using
/// AVAudioConverterPrimeMethod_None. If no more frames of input are available in the input stream
/// (because, for example, the desired end frame is at the end of an audio file), then zero
/// (silent) trailing frames will be synthesized for the client.
