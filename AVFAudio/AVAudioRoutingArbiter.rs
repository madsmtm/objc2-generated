    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// AirPods Automatic Switching is a feature of Apple operating systems that intelligently connects wireless headphones to the most appropriate audio device in a multidevice environment. For example, if a user plays a movie on iPad, and then locks the device and starts playing music on iPhone, the system automatically switches the source audio device from iPad to iPhone.
    ///
    /// iOS apps automatically participate in AirPods Automatic Switching. To enable your macOS app to participate in this behavior, use `AVAudioRoutingArbiter` to indicate when your app starts and finishes playing or recording audio. For example, a Voice over IP (VoIP) app might request arbitration before starting a call, and when the arbitration completes, begin the VoIP session. Likewise, when the call ends, the app would end the VoIP session and leave arbitration.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// func startCall() {
    ///     let arbiter = AVAudioRoutingArbiter.shared
    ///     arbiter.begin(category: .playAndRecordVoice) { deviceChanged, error in
    ///         // Start VoIP session.
    ///     }
    /// }
    ///
    /// func endCall() {
    ///     // End VoIP session.
    ///     AVAudioRoutingArbiter.shared.leave()
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
