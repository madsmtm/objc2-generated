/// A block that receives audio data from an audio sink node.

/// Parameters:
/// - timestamp: The time the input data renders.
///
/// - frameCount: The number of sample frames of input the engine provides.
///
/// - inputData: The input audio data.
///
///
/// ## Return Value
///
/// An `OSStatus` result code. When an error occurs, consider the audio data invalid.
///
///
/// Block to receive audio data from AVAudioSinkNode
///
/// Parameter `timestamp`: The time at which the input data will be rendered.
///
/// Parameter `frameCount`: The number of sample frames of input provided.
///
/// Parameter `inputData`: The input audio data.
///
/// The engine will supply valid buffers in inputData's mBuffers' mData and mDataByteSize.
/// mDataByteSize will be consistent with frameCount.
///
/// The pointer to the AudioBufferList is only valid within the scope of this block.
///
/// Returns: An OSStatus result code. If an error is returned, the input data should be assumed to be
/// invalid.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// You use an `AVAudioSinkNode` to receive audio data through [`AVAudioSinkNodeReceiverBlock`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosinknodereceiverblock). You only use it in the input chain.
    ///
    /// An audio sink node doesn’t support format conversion. When connecting, use the output format of the input for the format for the connection. The format should match the hardware input sample rate.
    ///
    /// The voice processing I/O unit is an exception to the above because it supports sample rate conversion. The input scope format (hardware format) and output scope format (client format) of the input node can differ in that case.
    ///
    /// An audio sink node doesn’t support manual rendering mode, and doesn’t have an output bus, so you can’t install a tap on it.
    ///
    ///
    /// AVAudioSinkNode wraps a client provided block to receive input audio on the audio IO thread.
    ///
    /// AVAudioSinkNode is restricted to be used in the input chain and does not support format
    /// conversion. Hence when connecting to an AVAudioSinkNode node, the format for the connection
    /// should be the output scope format of the input node (essentialy the format should match the input hardware
    /// sample rate).
    ///
    /// The voice processing IO unit is an exception to the above as it supports sample rate conversion.
    /// The input scope format (HW format) and output scope format (client format) of the input node can differ
    /// in that case.
    ///
    /// This node is only supported when the engine is rendering to the audio device and not in
    /// manual rendering mode.
    ///
    /// AVAudioSinkNode does not have an output bus and therefore it does not support tapping.
