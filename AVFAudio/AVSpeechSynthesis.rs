    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// To speak some text, create an [`AVSpeechUtterance`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avspeechutterance) instance that contains the text and pass it to [`speakUtterance:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avspeechsynthesizer/speak(_:)) on a speech synthesizer instance. You can optionally also retrieve an [`AVSpeechSynthesisVoice`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avspeechsynthesisvoice) and set it on the utterance’s [`voice`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avspeechutterance/voice) property to have the speech synthesizer use that voice when speaking the utterance’s text.
    ///
    /// The speech synthesizer maintains a queue of utterances that it speaks. If the synthesizer isn’t speaking, calling [`speakUtterance:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avspeechsynthesizer/speak(_:)) begins speaking that utterance either immediately or after pausing for its [`preUtteranceDelay`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avspeechutterance/preutterancedelay), if necessary. If the synthesizer is speaking, the synthesizer adds utterances to a queue and speaks them in the order it receives them.
    ///
    /// After speech begins, you can use the synthesizer object to pause or stop speech. After pausing, you can resume the speech from its paused point or stop the speech entirely and remove all remaining utterances in the queue.
    ///
    /// You can monitor the speech synthesizer by examining its [`speaking`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avspeechsynthesizer/isspeaking) and [`paused`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avspeechsynthesizer/ispaused) properties, or by setting a delegate that conforms to [`AVSpeechSynthesizerDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avspeechsynthesizerdelegate). The delegate receives significant events as they occur during speech synthesis.
    ///
    /// An `AVSpeechSynthesizer` also controls the route where the speech plays. For more information, see Directing speech output.
