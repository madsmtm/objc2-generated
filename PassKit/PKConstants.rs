///
/// 3. If the purchase amount exceeds the user’s PIN limit or if the purchase uses a currency code other than the one expected by the bank, Apple Pay prompts the user for their PIN.
///
/// 4. The user enters their PIN.

/// 5. Apple Pay calls the delegate’s [`paymentAuthorizationViewController:didAuthorizePayment:completion:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit/pkpaymentauthorizationviewcontrollerdelegate/paymentauthorizationviewcontroller(_:didauthorizepayment:completion:)) method.
