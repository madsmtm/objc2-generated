This represents the size of the image returned by the [`UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uigraphicsgetimagefromcurrentimagecontext()) function. To get the size of the bitmap in pixels, you must multiply the width and height values by the value in the `scale` parameter.
///
/// - opaque: A Boolean flag indicating whether the bitmap is opaque. If you know the bitmap is fully opaque, specify [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) to ignore the alpha channel and optimize the bitmap’s storage. Specifying [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) means that the bitmap must include an alpha channel to handle any partially transparent pixels.

/// You use this function to configure the drawing environment for rendering into a bitmap. The format for the bitmap is a ARGB 32-bit integer pixel format using host-byte order. If the opaque parameter is [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), the alpha channel is ignored and the bitmap is treated as fully opaque ([`kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipFirst`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/cgimagealphainfo/noneskipfirst) | [`kCGBitmapByteOrder32Host`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/kcgbitmapbyteorder32host)).

The supplied scale factor is also applied to the coordinate system and resulting images. The drawing environment is pushed onto the graphics context stack immediately.
///

When you are done modifying the context, you must call the [`UIGraphicsEndImageContext`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uigraphicsendimagecontext()) function to clean up the bitmap drawing environment and remove the graphics context from the top of the context stack.
