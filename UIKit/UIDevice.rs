    /// Use a [`UIDevice`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice) object to get information about the device such as assigned name, device model, and operating-system name and version. You also use the `UIDevice` instance to detect changes in the device’s characteristics, such as physical orientation. You get the current orientation using the [`orientation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/orientation) property or receive change notifications by registering for the [`UIDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/orientationdidchangenotification) notification. Before using either of these techniques to get orientation data, you must enable data delivery using the [`beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/begingeneratingdeviceorientationnotifications()) method. When you no longer need to track the device orientation, call the [`endGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/endgeneratingdeviceorientationnotifications()) method to disable the delivery of notifications.
    ///
    /// Similarly, you can use the `UIDevice` instance to obtain information and notifications about changes to the battery’s charge state (described by the [`batteryState`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/batterystate-swift.property) property) and charge level (described by the [`batteryLevel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/batterylevel) property). The `UIDevice` instance also provides access to the proximity sensor state (described by the [`proximityState`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/proximitystate) property). The proximity sensor detects whether the user is holding the device close to their face. Enable battery monitoring or proximity sensing only when you need it.
    ///
    /// You can also use the [`playInputClick`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/playinputclick()) instance method to play keyboard input clicks in custom input and keyboard accessory views.
