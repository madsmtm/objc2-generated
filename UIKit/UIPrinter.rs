    /// Most of the time, you use a [`UIPrinterPickerController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiprinterpickercontroller) object to retrieve a printer object representing the printer selected by the user. If you already have a URL containing the address of a printer—perhaps one that was previously selected by the user—you can use that URL to create a printer object directly. When creating your own printer objects, you must connect to the printer using the [`contactPrinter:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiprinter/contactprinter(_:)) method before retrieving any of the printer’s attributes.
