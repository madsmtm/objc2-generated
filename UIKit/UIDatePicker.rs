/// A date picker style determines how your app displays the date picker value and its editor. For instance, a date picker with a [`datePickerMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/datepickermode) of [`UIDatePickerModeDateAndTime`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/mode/dateandtime) and [`datePickerStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/datepickerstyle) of [`UIDatePickerStyleCompact`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepickerstyle/compact) displays the date picker’s value as a label that the user can tap to view a calendar-style editor. On the other hand, the same date picker using the [`UIDatePickerStyleInline`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepickerstyle/inline) style displays a view that lets the user edit the value without having to tap the label shown in the [`UIDatePickerStyleCompact`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepickerstyle/compact) style.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// You can use a date picker to allow a user to enter either a point in time (calendar date, time value, or both) or a time interval (for example, for a timer). The date picker reports interactions to its associated target object.
    ///
    /// To add a date picker to your interface:
    ///
    /// - Set the date picker mode at creation time.
    ///
    /// - Supply additional configuration options such as minimum and maximum dates if required.
    ///
    /// - Connect an action method to the date picker.
    ///
    /// - Set up Auto Layout rules to govern the position of the date picker in your interface.
    ///
    /// You use a date picker only for handling the selection of times and dates. If you want to handle the selection of arbitrary items from a list, use a [`UIPickerView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uipickerview) object.
    ///
    /// ### Configure a date picker
    ///
    /// The [`datePickerMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/datepickermode) property determines the configuration of a date picker. You can set the [`datePickerMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/datepickermode) value programmatically or in Interface Builder. For modes that include date or time values, you can also configure the locale, calendar, and time zone information. The date picker uses that information when formatting date and time values for the current user, and defaults to the device’s locale, calendar, and time zone. The [`date`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/date) property represents the currently selected date in the form of an [`NSDate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdate) object, which is calendar and time zone agnostic.
    ///
    /// To limit the range of dates that the user can select, assign values to the [`minimumDate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/minimumdate) and [`maximumDate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/maximumdate) properties. You can also use the [`minuteInterval`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/minuteinterval) property to allow only specific time increments.
    ///
    /// Setting the [`datePickerMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/datepickermode) property to [`UIDatePickerModeCountDownTimer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/mode/countdowntimer) allows the user to choose a duration in hours and minutes. When in this mode, the [`countDownDuration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/countdownduration) property represents the displayed duration, measured in seconds as an [`NSTimeInterval`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/timeinterval). Note that even though you set this property in seconds, the date picker can only show values in minutes.
    ///
    /// The figure below shows a date picker configured with the [`datePickerMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/datepickermode) property set to [`UIDatePickerModeCountDownTimer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/mode/countdowntimer) and the [`minuteInterval`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/minuteinterval) property set to `5`. The value of [`countDownDuration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/countdownduration) is currently `4500`.

    /// ### Respond to user interaction
    ///
    /// Date pickers use the target-action design pattern to notify your app when the user changes the selected date. To be notified when the date picker’s value changes, register your action method with the [`UIControlEventValueChanged`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicontrol/event/valuechanged) event. At runtime the date picker calls your methods in response to the user selecting a date or time.
    ///
    /// You connect a date picker to your action method using the [`addTarget:action:forControlEvents:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicontrol/addtarget(_:action:for:)) method or by creating a connection in Interface Builder.

Choose the form that provides the information that you need to respond to the value change in the date picker.

    /// ### Debug date pickers
    ///
    /// When debugging issues with date pickers, watch for these common pitfalls:

    /// - **The minimum date must be earlier than the maximum date.** Check the bounds of your [`minimumDate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/minimumdate) and [`maximumDate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/maximumdate) properties. If the maximum date is less than the minimum date, both properties are ignored, and the date picker allows the selection of any date value. The minimum and maximum dates are ignored in the countdown-timer mode ([`UIDatePickerModeCountDownTimer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/mode/countdowntimer)).
    ///
    /// - **The minute interval must be a divisor of 60.** Check that the [`minuteInterval`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/minuteinterval) value can be evenly divided into 60; otherwise, the default value is used (`1`).

    ///
    /// ### Specify a locale
    ///
    /// Date pickers handle their own internationalization; the only thing you need to do is specify the appropriate locale. You can choose a specific locale for your date picker to appear in by setting the Locale ([`locale`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker/locale)) field in Attributes Inspector. Setting the locale changes the language that the date picker uses for display, but also the format of the date and time (for example, certain locales present days before month names, or prefer a 24-hour clock over a 12-hour clock). The width of the date picker automatically accommodates for the length of the localization. To use the system language, leave this property set to default.

    /// ### Support accessibility and VoiceOver
    ///
    /// Date pickers are accessible by default. Each time component in the date picker is its own accessibility element and has the Adjustable ([`UIAccessibilityTraitAdjustable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilitytraits/adjustable)) trait.
    ///
    /// The device reads the accessibility value, traits, and hint out loud for each date picker when the user enables VoiceOver. VoiceOver speaks this information when a user taps on a picker wheel.

    ///
    /// ```objc
    /// "2 o'clock. Picker item. Adjustable. Swipe up or down with one finger to adjust the value."
    /// ```
    ///
