    /// An object that coordinates the creation of PDF screenshots of an app’s content.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// When people take a screenshot of your app’s content, you work with a [`UIScreenshotService`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscreenshotservice) object to provide a PDF version of that screenshot. You don’t create a [`UIScreenshotService`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscreenshotservice) object directly. Instead, you retrieve the object from the [`screenshotService`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiwindowscene/screenshotservice) property of your window scene and assign a delegate to it. Then when people take a screenshot, UIKit asks your delegate for the PDF data.
    ///
    /// For information about how to provide the PDF data, see [`UIScreenshotServiceDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscreenshotservicedelegate).
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Tip
    ///  Beginning in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, people have the option to share or save the generated full page screenshot as a PDF or an image.
    ///
    ///
    ///
    /// </div>
    ///
    /// This class allows your application to produce a higher fidelity, PDF screenshot to the user. Set the delegate so that when a screenshot is taken, screenshots can show the full document content from the application.
