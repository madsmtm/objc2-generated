    /// A [`UIScreen`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscreen) object provides information about the screens attached to an iOS, iPadOS, or tvOS device. A screen object for an iOS or iPadOS device has information about the integrated display or an attached display. A screen object for a tvOS device represents the television connected to the device. In a compatible iPad or iPhone app running in visionOS, don’t rely on screen-related properties to configure your app.
    ///
    /// You don’t create any of these screen objects directly. Instead, fetch the screen object for one of your app’s windows from the [`UIWindowScene`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiwindowscene) object that manages the window.
    ///
    /// Avoid using screen objects to make decisions about your app’s interface. Use a screen object only as needed to retrieve screen-related information, such as the screen’s bounds rectangle, brightness, and overscan settings. Apps that rely on the screen dimensions can use the object in the [`fixedCoordinateSpace`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscreen/fixedcoordinatespace) property as a fixed point of reference for any calculations they must make.
