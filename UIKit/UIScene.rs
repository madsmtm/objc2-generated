    /// An object that represents one instance of your app’s user interface.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// UIKit creates a scene object for each instance of your app’s UI that the user or your app requests. Typically, UIKit creates a [`UIWindowScene`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiwindowscene) object instead of a [`UIScene`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscene) object, but you use the methods and properties of this class to access information about a scene.
    ///
    /// Every scene object has an associated delegate object, an object that adopts the [`UISceneDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate) protocol. When the state of the scene changes, the scene object notifies its delegate object and posts appropriate notifications to registered observer objects. Use the delegate object and notifications to respond to changes in the state of the scene. For example, use it to determine when your scene moves to the background.
    ///
    /// You don’t create scene objects directly. You can programmatically ask UIKit to create a scene object for your app by calling the [`requestSceneSessionActivation:userActivity:options:errorHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication/requestscenesessionactivation(_:useractivity:options:errorhandler:)) method of [`UIApplication`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication). UIKit also creates scenes in response to user interactions. When configuring your app’s scene support, specify [`UIWindowScene`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiwindowscene) objects instead of [`UIScene`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscene) objects.
