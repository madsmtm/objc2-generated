    /// A continuous gesture recognizer that interprets rotation gestures involving two touches.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// [`UIRotationGestureRecognizer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uirotationgesturerecognizer) is a concrete subclass of [`UIGestureRecognizer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uigesturerecognizer).
    ///
    /// The user must press two fingers on a view while rotating it. When the user moves the fingers opposite each other in a circular motion, the underlying view rotates in a corresponding direction and speed.
    ///
    /// Rotation is a continuous gesture. It begins when the user moves the two fingers enough to create a rotation gesture. The gesture changes when a finger moves while both fingers remain touching. It ends when the user lifts both fingers. At each stage in the gesture, the gesture recognizer sends its action message.
