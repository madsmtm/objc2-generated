/// A color transformer takes an input color and modifies it to produce a different output color. For example, you might have a color transformer that returns a grayscale or reduced alpha version of the input color.
///
/// Because color transformers can use the same base input color to produce a number of variants of that color, you can create different appearances for different states of your views.
