    /// Use a [`UIBarButtonItemStateAppearance`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uibarbuttonitemstateappearance) object to customize the title and background image of your bar button items. Don’t create [`UIBarButtonItemStateAppearance`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uibarbuttonitemstateappearance) objects yourself. Instead, create a [`UIBarButtonItemAppearance`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uibarbuttonitemappearance) object and use its properties to fetch the appearance attributes for the button in a particular state. For example, to set the button’s attributes when it’s in the normal state, configure the object in the [`normal`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uibarbuttonitemappearance/normal) property.
