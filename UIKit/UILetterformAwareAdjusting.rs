/// Constants that specify typographic bounds-sizing behavior to handle text in fonts with oversize characters.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// For more information on typographic bounds sizing behavior, see [`UILetterformAwareAdjusting`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiletterformawareadjusting).
///
///
/// Background
///
/// When fonts created with `+[UIFont preferredFontForTextStyle:]` are used, UILabel, UITextField, and nonscrollable
/// UITextView will increase the height calculated in `-sizeThatFits:` and `-intrinsicContentSize` in the presence
/// of tall scripts.
///
/// Even with this increase, there will be some extreme ascenders and descenders that extend beyond this height.
///
/// Furthermore, this increase only occurs for the text-style fonts, so for non-text-style fonts such cases will be markedly more common.
// NS_ENUM

    /// In [`UILabel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uilabel), [`UITextField`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextfield), or a nonscrollable [`UITextView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextview), [`sizeThatFits:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/sizethatfits(_:)) and [`intrinsicContentSize`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/intrinsiccontentsize) increase the height calculated for tall scripts when you present text that contains oversize characters in a font that you create with  [`preferredFontForTextStyle:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uifont/preferredfont(fortextstyle:)). Even with the increase, some extreme ascenders and descenders may extend beyond the view’s bounds and appear to be clipped. For nontext-style fonts, [`sizeThatFits:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/sizethatfits(_:)) and [`intrinsicContentSize`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/intrinsiccontentsize) don’t increase the calculated height for oversize characters. This is the default, standard behavior. Set [`sizingRule`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiletterformawareadjusting/sizingrule) to [`UILetterformAwareSizingRuleTypographic`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiletterformawaresizingrule/typographic) to use this behavior explicitly.
    ///
    /// To adjust the boundary calculations in [`sizeThatFits:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/sizethatfits(_:)) and [`intrinsicContentSize`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/intrinsiccontentsize) to account for oversize characters, set [`sizingRule`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiletterformawareadjusting/sizingrule) to [`UILetterformAwareSizingRuleOversize`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiletterformawaresizingrule/oversize). Note that the larger bounds to accommodate oversize characters may negatively impact typographic alignment, such as vertical edge alignment, vertical edge-to-edge spacing, or vertical centering.
