    /// An object that prepares for and performs the visual transition between two view controllers.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The [`UIStoryboardSegue`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uistoryboardsegue) class supports the standard visual transitions available in UIKit. You can also subclass to define custom transitions between the view controllers in your storyboard file.
    ///
    /// Segue objects contain information about the view controllers involved in a transition. When a segue is triggered, but before the visual transition occurs, the storyboard runtime calls the current view controller’s [`prepareForSegue:sender:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/prepare(for:sender:)) method so that it can pass any needed data to the view controller that’s about to be displayed.
    ///
    /// You don’t create segue objects directly. Instead, the storyboard runtime creates them when it must perform a segue between two view controllers. You can still initiate a segue programmatically using the [`performSegueWithIdentifier:sender:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/performsegue(withidentifier:sender:)) method of [`UIViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller) if you want. You might do so to initiate a segue from a source that was added programmatically and therefore not available in Interface Builder.
    ///
    /// ### Subclassing notes
    ///
    /// You can subclass [`UIStoryboardSegue`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uistoryboardsegue) in situations where you want to provide a custom transition between view controllers in your application. To use your custom segue, create a segue line between the appropriate view controllers in Interface Builder and set its type to Custom in the inspector; you must also specify the class name of the segue to use in the inspector.
    ///
    /// When the storyboard runtime detects a custom segue, it creates a new instance of your class, configures it with the view controller objects, asks the view controller source to prepare for the segue, and then performs the segue.
    ///
    /// #### Methods to override
    ///
    /// For custom segues, the main method you need to override is the [`perform`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uistoryboardsegue/perform()) method. The storyboard runtime calls this method when it’s time to perform the visual transition from the view controller in [`sourceViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uistoryboardsegue/source) to the view controller in [`destinationViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uistoryboardsegue/destination). If you need to initialize any variables in your custom segue subclass, you can also override the [`initWithIdentifier:source:destination:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uistoryboardsegue/init(identifier:source:destination:)) method and initialize them in your custom implementation.
    ///
    /// #### Alternatives to subclassing
    ///
    /// If your segue doesn’t need to store additional information or provide anything other than a [`perform`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uistoryboardsegue/perform()) method, consider using the [`segueWithIdentifier:source:destination:performHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uistoryboardsegue/init(identifier:source:destination:performhandler:)) method instead.
