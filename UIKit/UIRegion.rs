    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// When creating animations, you use regions to define the effective area of a field behavior such as a magnetic or gravitational force. Most regions are rectangular or elliptical in shape, but you can use the methods of this class to create more complex shapes by adding, subtracting, and intersecting other regions.
    ///
    /// When creating a new region, you specify only the size of the corresponding rectangle or circle. The origin of a newly created region is at the center of the specified area, and any mathematical manipulations you make to the region occur relative to that origin point.
