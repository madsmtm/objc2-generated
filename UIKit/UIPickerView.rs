    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// A picker view displays one or more wheels that the user manipulates to select items. Each wheel — known as a _component_ — has a series of indexed rows representing the selectable items. Each row displays a string or view so that the user can identify the item on that row. Users select items by rotating the wheels to the desired values, which align with a selection indicator.
