    ///
    /// To use an image picker controller containing its default controls, perform these steps:
    ///
    /// 1. Verify that the device is capable of picking content from the desired source. Do this by calling the [`isSourceTypeAvailable:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/issourcetypeavailable(_:)) class method, providing a constant from the [`UIImagePickerControllerSourceType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/sourcetype-swift.enum) enumeration.

Check which media types are available for the source type you’re using, by calling the [`availableMediaTypesForSourceType:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/availablemediatypes(for:)) class method.

    ///
    /// 3. Tell the image picker controller to adjust the UI according to the media types you want to make available — still images, movies, or both — by setting the [`mediaTypes`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/mediatypes) property.

    /// 4. Present the user interface. On iPhone or iPod touch, do this modally (full screen) by calling the [`presentViewController:animated:completion:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/present(_:animated:completion:)) method of the currently active view controller, passing your configured image picker controller as the new view controller.

To do this, provide an overlay view containing the controls you want to display, and use the methods described in [Capturing still images or movies](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller#capturing-still-images-or-movies). You can display your custom overlay view in addition to, or instead of, the default controls. Custom overlay views for the `UIImagePickerController` class are available in iOS 3.1 and later by way of the [`cameraOverlayView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/cameraoverlayview) property.

    ///
    /// ### Important
    ///  The `UIImagePickerController` class supports portrait mode only. This class is intended to be used as-is and doesn’t support subclassing. The view hierarchy for this class is private and must not be modified, with one exception. You can assign a custom view to the [`cameraOverlayView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/cameraoverlayview) property and use that view to present additional information or manage the interactions between the camera interface and your code.
    ///
    ///
    ///
    /// </div>
    /// ### Provide a delegate object
    ///
    /// To use an image picker controller, you must provide a delegate that conforms to the [`UIImagePickerControllerDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontrollerdelegate) protocol. Starting in iOS 4.1, you can use the delegate to save still-image metadata to the photo library along with the image. See [`UIImagePickerControllerDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontrollerdelegate).
    ///
    /// ### Observe required viewing standards
    ///
    /// As a view controller that renders on top of your app for the temporary purpose of selecting images, the picker controller expects your app to keep its contents visible as a prerequisite to operation. In iOS 17 and later, the picker controller ignores touch events while its opacity is anything other than fully opaque. If your app alters the controller’s visibility, such as by adjusting the [`opacity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer/opacity) of its view’s layer, the picker controller disables user interaction.
    ///
    /// ### Adjust flash mode
    ///
    /// In iOS 4.0 and later, you can provide custom controls to let the user adjust flash mode (on devices that have a flash LED), pick which camera to use (on devices that have a front and rear camera), and switch between still image and movie capture. You can also manage these settings programmatically. You can also manipulate the flash directly to provide effects, such as a strobe light. Present a picker interface set to use video capture mode. Then, turn the flash LED on or off by setting the [`cameraFlashMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/cameraflashmode-swift.property) property to [`UIImagePickerControllerCameraFlashModeOn`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/cameraflashmode-swift.enum/on) or [`UIImagePickerControllerCameraFlashModeOff`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/cameraflashmode-swift.enum/off).
    ///
    /// ### Work with movies
    ///
    /// Movie capture has a default duration limit of 10 minutes but can be adjusted using the [`videoMaximumDuration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/videomaximumduration) property. When a person taps the Share button to send a movie to MMS, YouTube, or another destination, the system applies duration and video quality limitations.
    ///
    /// The default camera interface supports editing movies in the photo library. Editing involves trimming from the start or end of the movie, then saving the trimmed movie. To display an interface dedicated to movie editing, rather than one that also supports recording new movies, use the [`UIVideoEditorController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uivideoeditorcontroller) class instead of this one. See [`UIVideoEditorController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uivideoeditorcontroller).
    ///
    /// ### Work with Live Photos
    ///
    /// Live Photos is a Camera app feature on supported devices, enabling a picture to be not just a single moment in time but to include motion and sound from the moments just before and after its capture. A [`PHLivePhoto`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photos/phlivephoto) object represents a Live Photo, and the [`PHLivePhotoView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photosui/phlivephotoview) class provides a system-standard, interactive user interface for displaying a Live Photo and playing back its content.
    ///
    /// Although Live Photos include sound and motion, they remain photos. When you use an image picker controller to capture or choose still images (by including only the `kUTTypeImage` type in the [`mediaTypes`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/mediatypes) array), assets that were captured as Live Photos continue to appear in the picker. However, when the user chooses an asset, your [`delegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/delegate) object receives only a [`UIImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage) object containing a still-image representation of the Live Photo.

    /// To obtain the full motion and sound content when the user chooses a Live Photo with the image picker, you must include _both_ the `kUTTypeImage` and `kUTTypeLivePhoto` types in the [`mediaTypes`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/mediatypes) array. For more information, see [`UIImagePickerControllerLivePhoto`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/infokey/livephoto) in [`UIImagePickerControllerDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontrollerdelegate).
    ///
    /// ### Perform fully customized media capture and browsing
    ///
    /// To perform fully customized image or movie capture, instead use the [`AVFoundation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation) framework as described in [Still and Video Media Capture](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/AVFoundationPG/Articles/00_Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010188-CH1-SW10). Camera access using the AVFoundation framework is available starting in iOS 4.0.
    ///
    /// To create a fully customized image picker for browsing the photo library, use classes from the Photos framework. For example, you could create a custom image picker that displays larger thumbnail images generated and cached by iOS, that makes use of image metadata including timestamp and location information, or that integrates with other features such as MapKit and iCloud Photo Sharing. For more information, see [PhotoKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit). Media browsing using the Photos framework is available starting in iOS 8.0.

    /// ## Discussion
    ///
    /// When you use this function with an image picker controller, you’d typically call it within your [`imagePickerController:didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontrollerdelegate/imagepickercontroller(_:didfinishpickingmediawithinfo:)) delegate method implementation.
    ///
    /// Before calling this function, call the [`UIVideoAtPathIsCompatibleWithSavedPhotosAlbum`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uivideoatpathiscompatiblewithsavedphotosalbum(_:)) function to determine if it’s possible to save movies to the Camera Roll album. For a code example, refer to [Camera Programming Topics for iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/CameraAndPhotoLib_TopicsForIOS/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010400).

    /// The use of the `completionTarget`, `completionSelector`, and `contextInfo` parameters is optional and necessary only if you want to receive an asynchronous notification when the function finishes writing the movie to the user’s Camera Roll or Saved Photos album. If you don’t want to receive a notification, pass `nil` for these parameters.
