    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// If you’re developing an authorization plug-in, you can subclass the [`SFAuthorizationPluginView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/securityinterface/sfauthorizationpluginview) class to create views that provide a custom user interface for your plug-in. By subclassing the [`SFAuthorizationPluginView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/securityinterface/sfauthorizationpluginview) class, you avoid changing or duplicating the Apple-provided authentication or login window dialogs to display your custom view.
    ///
    /// To instantiate your [`SFAuthorizationPluginView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/securityinterface/sfauthorizationpluginview) subclass, you need the callbacks structure containing entry points to the Security Server that you receive in your plug-in’s [`AuthorizationPluginCreate`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/1543160-authorizationplugincreate) function and the authorization engine handle you receive in your plug-in’s [`MechanismCreate`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/authorizationplugininterface/1543181-mechanismcreate) function.
    ///
    /// Your custom subclass of [`SFAuthorizationPluginView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/securityinterface/sfauthorizationpluginview) must override the following methods:
    ///
    /// - [`buttonPressed:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/securityinterface/sfauthorizationpluginview/buttonpressed(_:))
    ///
    /// - [`viewForType:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/securityinterface/sfauthorizationpluginview/view(for:))
    ///
    ///
    /// SFAuthorizationPluginView is a class that you can use to insert an NSView into AuthorizationPlugin interfaces.
    ///
    /// SFAuthorizationPluginView provides AuthorizationPlugin writers with an easy way to provide a user interface for their AuthorizationPlugin without having to duplicate the standard authentication dialog or the login window dialog.  This class was designed to be subclassed by the AuthorizationPlugin writer.  The following methods were designed to be overridden: buttonPressed:, didActivate, willActivateWithUser:, didDeactivate, firstKeyView, firstResponder, lastKeyView, setEnabled:, and viewForType:.  In order to display the user interface, the AuthorizationPlugin should create an instance of your subclass and then call displayView.  That will cause the appropriate dialog to be displayed and when credentials are needed, the overridden methods will be called in order to display the NSView provided by the subclass.
