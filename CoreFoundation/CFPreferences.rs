/// Determines whether or not a given key has been imposed on the user.
///
/// Parameters:
/// - key: The key you are querying.
///
/// - applicationID: The application’s ID, typically [`kCFPreferencesCurrentApplication`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/kcfpreferencescurrentapplication). Do not pass `NULL` or [`kCFPreferencesAnyApplication`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/kcfpreferencesanyapplication). Takes the form of a Java package name, `com.foosoft`.
///
///
/// ## Return Value
///
/// `true` if value of the key cannot be changed by the user, otherwise `false`.
///
///
///
/// ## Discussion
///
/// In cases where machines and/or users are under some kind of management, you should use this function to determine whether or not to disable UI elements corresponding to those preference keys.
