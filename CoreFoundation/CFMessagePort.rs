///
/// ## Overview
///
/// CFMessagePort objects provide a communications channel that can transmit arbitrary data between multiple threads or processes on the local machine.
///
/// You create a local message port with [`CFMessagePortCreateLocal`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfmessageportcreatelocal(_:_:_:_:_:)) and make it available to other processes by giving it a name, either when you create it or later with [`CFMessagePortSetName`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfmessageportsetname(_:_:)). Other processes then connect to it using [`CFMessagePortCreateRemote`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfmessageportcreateremote(_:_:)), specifying the name of the port.
///
/// To listen for messages, you need to create a run loop source with [`CFMessagePortCreateRunLoopSource`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfmessageportcreaterunloopsource(_:_:_:)) and add it to a run loop with [`CFRunLoopAddSource`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfrunloopaddsource(_:_:_:)).
///
/// <div class="warning">
///
/// ### Important
///  If you want to tear down the connection, you must invalidate the port (using [`CFMessagePortInvalidate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfmessageportinvalidate(_:))) before releasing the runloop source and the message port object.
///
///
///
/// </div>
/// Your message port’s callback function will be called when a message arrives. To send data, you store the data in a CFData object and call [`CFMessagePortSendRequest`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfmessageportsendrequest(_:_:_:_:_:_:_:)). You can optionally have the function wait for a reply and return the reply in another CFData object.
///
/// Message ports only support communication on the local machine. For network communication, you have to use a [`CFSocketRef`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfsocket) object.
///
///
///
/// This is toll-free bridged with `NSMessagePort`.

    ///
    /// The new CFRunLoopSource object for `ms`. Ownership follows the [The Create Rule](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFMemoryMgmt/Concepts/Ownership.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001148-103029).

    ///
    /// ## Discussion
    ///
    /// The run loop source is not automatically added to a run loop. To add the source to a run loop, use [`CFRunLoopAddSource`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfrunloopaddsource(_:_:_:)).
    ///
    /// ### Special Considerations
    ///
    /// This method is not available on iOS 7 and later—it will return `NULL` and log a sandbox violation in `syslog`. See [Concurrency Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ConcurrencyProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008091) for possible replacement technologies.
