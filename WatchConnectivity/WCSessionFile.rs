    /// You do not create instances of this class directly. When you initiate a file transfer using the [`transferFile:metadata:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchconnectivity/wcsession/transferfile(_:metadata:))  method of your app’s [`WCSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchconnectivity/wcsession) object, the session creates an instance when it queues the file for transfer. You can get a list of in-progress transfers initiated by your app from the session’s [`outstandingFileTransfers`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchconnectivity/wcsession/outstandingfiletransfers) property. When a file is received by your app, the corresponding file object is delivered directly to your session’s delegate.
