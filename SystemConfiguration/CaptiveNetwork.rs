/// The requesting app must meet one of the following requirements:

/// - The app uses [`Core Location`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation), and has the user’s authorization to use location information.
///
/// - The app uses the [`NEHotspotConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/nehotspotconfiguration) API to configure the current Wi-Fi network.
///
/// - The app has an active VPN configuration installed.
///
/// - The app has an active [`NEDNSSettingsManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/nednssettingsmanager) configuration installed.
///
/// If the requesting app is a Mac app built with Mac Catalyst, it must meet the following requirements:
///
/// - The app uses [`Core Location`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation), and has the user’s authorization to use location information.

/// - The app includes the [`Access Wi-Fi Information Entitlement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.networking.wifi-info).
