    /// Methods that model a hierarchical timing system, allowing objects to map time between their parent and local time.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Absolute time is defined as mach time converted to seconds. The [`CACurrentMediaTime`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/cacurrentmediatime()) function is provided as a convenience for getting the current absolute time.
    ///
    /// The conversion from parent time to local time has two stages:
    ///
    /// 1. Conversion to “active local time.” This includes the point at which the object appears in the parent object’s timeline and how fast it plays relative to the parent.
    ///
    /// 2. Conversion from “active local time” to “basic local time.” The timing model allows for objects to repeat their basic duration multiple times and, optionally, to play backwards before repeating.
    ///
