    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The [`CAScrollLayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/cascrolllayer) class is a subclass of [`CALayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer) that simplifies displaying a portion of a layer. The extent of the scrollable area of the [`CAScrollLayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/cascrolllayer) is defined by the layout of its sublayers. The visible portion of the layer content is set by specifying the origin as a point or a rectangular area of the contents to be displayed. [`CAScrollLayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/cascrolllayer) does not provide keyboard or mouse event-handling, nor does it provide visible scrollers.
