    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// `CAMediaTimingFunction` represents one segment of a function that defines the pacing of an animation as a timing curve. The function maps an input time normalized to the range `[0,1]` to an output time also in the range `[0,1]`.
    ///
    /// You can create a media timing function by supplying your own cubic Bézier curve control points using the [`initWithControlPoints::::`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/camediatimingfunction/init(controlpoints:_:_:_:)) method or by using one of the predefined timing functions.
