    /// A list or range of sizes that augment an image constraint’s default size.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// You use an `MLImageSizeConstraint` to express what image sizes of an image feature a model will accept as input or produce as output.
    ///
    /// Use [`type`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlimagesizeconstraint/type) to determine which properties describe what image sizes the model’s image feature expects as input or produces as output.
    ///
    /// If `type` is:
    ///
    /// - [`MLImageSizeConstraintTypeRange`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlimagesizeconstrainttype/range), the image feature accepts any image that has a width in [`pixelsWideRange`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlimagesizeconstraint/pixelswiderange) and a height in [`pixelsHighRange`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlimagesizeconstraint/pixelshighrange).
    ///
    /// - [`MLImageSizeConstraintTypeEnumerated`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlimagesizeconstrainttype/enumerated), the image feature accepts any image size listed in [`enumeratedImageSizes`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlimagesizeconstraint/enumeratedimagesizes).
    ///
    /// - [`MLImageSizeConstraintTypeUnspecified`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlimagesizeconstrainttype/unspecified), the `MLImageSizeConstraint` instance is not configured and should be ignored. Instead, use the image feature’s default image size constraint, defined by [`pixelsWide`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlimageconstraint/pixelswide) and [`pixelsHigh`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlimageconstraint/pixelshigh).
