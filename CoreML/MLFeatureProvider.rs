extern_protocol!(
    /// An interface that represents a collection of values for either a model’s input or its output.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Use `MLFeatureProvider` to customize the way your app gets data to and from your model when the model’s dynamically generated interface doesn’t meet your app’s needs.
    ///
    /// Consider adopting this protocol in your data source if any of the following apply:
    ///
    /// - Your data is collected asynchronously.
    ///
    /// - Using the autogenerated interface leads to copying excessive amounts of data.
    ///
    /// - Your data source is otherwise complicated.
    ///
    /// The interface is mainly an accessor for [`MLFeatureValue`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlfeaturevalue) instances, making it straightforward to implement. Adopting this protocol allows you to integrate your data directly with [`MLModel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlmodel), which means the model can query your data sources without constructing a separate input instance.
    ///
    /// To customize your app’s interaction with a model:
    ///
    /// 1. Adopt the `MLFeatureProvider` protocol in a class or structure so that the model can query it for input feature values via [`featureValueForName:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlfeatureprovider/featurevalue(for:)).
    ///
    /// 2. Pass your app’s `MLFeatureProvider` to your `MLModel` with [`predictionFromFeatures:error:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlmodel/prediction(from:)-9y2aa) or [`predictionFromFeatures:options:error:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlmodel/prediction(from:options:)-81mr6).
    ///
    /// 3. Use the `MLFeatureProvider` returned from a `prediction(from:)` method to get the output feature values for that prediction.
    ///
    ///
