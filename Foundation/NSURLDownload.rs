Other delegate methods provide facilities that allow the delegate to customize the process of performing an asynchronous URL load.
    ///
    /// Note that these delegate methods will be called on the thread that started the asynchronous load operation for the associated [`NSURLDownload`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurldownload) object.
    ///
    /// - A [`downloadDidBegin:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurldownloaddelegate/downloaddidbegin(_:)) message will be sent to the delegate immediately upon starting the download.
    ///
    /// - Zero or more [`download:willSendRequest:redirectResponse:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurldownloaddelegate/download(_:willsend:redirectresponse:)) messages will be sent to the delegate before any further messages are sent if it is determined that the download must redirect to a new location. The delegate can allow the redirect, modify the destination or deny the redirect.
    ///
    /// - Zero or more [`download:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurldownloaddelegate/download(_:didreceive:)-1pc0v) messages will be sent to the delegate if it is necessary to authenticate in order to download the request and NSURLDownload does not already have authenticated credentials.
    ///
    /// - Zero or more [`download:didCancelAuthenticationChallenge:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurldownloaddelegate/download(_:didcancel:)) messages will be sent to the delegate if [`NSURLDownload`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurldownload) cancels the authentication challenge due to encountering a protocol implementation error.
    ///
    /// - Zero or more [`download:didReceiveResponse:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurldownloaddelegate/download(_:didreceive:)-817z3) messages will be sent to the delegate before receiving a [`download:didReceiveDataOfLength:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurldownloaddelegate/download(_:didreceivedataoflength:)) message. The only case where [`download:didReceiveResponse:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurldownloaddelegate/download(_:didreceive:)-817z3) is not sent to a delegate is when the protocol implementation encounters an error before a response could be created.
    ///

    ///
    /// - Zero or one [`download:decideDestinationWithSuggestedFilename:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurldownloaddelegate/download(_:decidedestinationwithsuggestedfilename:)) will be sent to the delegate when sufficient information has been received to determine the suggested filename for the downloaded file. The delegate will not receive this message if [`setDestination:allowOverwrite:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurldownload/setdestination(_:allowoverwrite:)) has already been sent to the [`NSURLDownload`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurldownload) instance.
    ///
    /// - A [`download:didCreateDestination:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurldownloaddelegate/download(_:didcreatedestination:)) message will be sent to the delegate when the [`NSURLDownload`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurldownload) instance creates the file on disk.
    ///
    /// - If NSURLDownload determines that the downloaded file is in a format that it is able to decode (MacBinary, Binhex or gzip), the delegate will receive a [`download:shouldDecodeSourceDataOfMIMEType:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurldownloaddelegate/download(_:shoulddecodesourcedataofmimetype:)). The delegate should return [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) to decode the data, [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) otherwise.
