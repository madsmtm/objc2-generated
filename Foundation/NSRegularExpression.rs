    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The fundamental matching method for [`NSRegularExpression`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsregularexpression) is a Block iterator method that allows clients to supply a Block object which will be invoked each time the regular expression matches a portion of the target string.  There are additional convenience methods for returning all the matches as an array, the total number of matches, the first match, and the range of the first match.
    ///
    /// An individual match is represented by an instance of the [`NSTextCheckingResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstextcheckingresult) class, which carries information about the overall matched range (via its [`range`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstextcheckingresult/range) property), and the range of each individual capture group (via the [`rangeAtIndex:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstextcheckingresult/range(at:)) method).  For basic [`NSRegularExpression`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsregularexpression) objects, these match results will be of type [`NSTextCheckingTypeRegularExpression`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstextcheckingresult/checkingtype/regularexpression), but subclasses may use other types.

    /// ### Note
    ///  [`NSRegularExpression`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsregularexpression) conforms to the International Components for Unicode ([ICU](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/)) specification for [regular expressions](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/strings/regexp.html).

    /// ### Examples Using NSRegularExpression
    ///
    /// What follows are a set of graduated examples for using the `NSRegularExpression` class. All these examples use the regular expression `\\b(a|b)(c|d)\\b` as their regular expression.
    ///
    /// This snippet creates a regular expression to match two-letter words, in which the first letter is “a” or “b” and the second letter is “c” or “d”. Specifying [`NSRegularExpressionCaseInsensitive`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsregularexpression/options-swift.struct/caseinsensitive) means that matches will be case-insensitive, so this will match “BC”, “aD”, and so forth, as well as their lower-case equivalents.

    /// A specialized regular expression object that matches natural language text for predefined data patterns.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Find dates, addresses, links, phone numbers, and transit information in natural language text with `NSDataDetector`.
    ///
    /// `NSDataDetector` returns the results of matching content in [`NSTextCheckingResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstextcheckingresult) objects. The [`NSTextCheckingResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstextcheckingresult) objects that `NSDataDetector` returns are different from those that [`NSRegularExpression`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsregularexpression) returns. The results are one of the data detector’s types and contain the corresponding properties. For example, results of type [`NSTextCheckingTypeDate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstextcheckingresult/checkingtype/date) have a [`date`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstextcheckingresult/date), [`timeZone`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstextcheckingresult/timezone), and [`duration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstextcheckingresult/duration); and results of type [`NSTextCheckingTypeLink`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstextcheckingresult/checkingtype/link) have a [`URL`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstextcheckingresult/url).
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Important
    ///  Don’t use `NSDataDetector` to validate data. `NSDataDetector` discards potential matches in case of uncertainty. Use a class specific to the type of data for validation instead. For example, attempt to instantiate a [`URL`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url) object using [`init(string:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url/init(string:)) to validate a URL string. A valid URL string returns an instance of [`URL`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url), while an invalid URL string returns [`nil`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nil-227m0).
    ///
    ///
    ///
    /// </div>
    /// ### Examples
    ///
    /// The following shows several graduated examples of using the `NSDataDetector` class.
    ///
    /// This code fragment creates a data detector that finds URL links and phone numbers. If an error occurs, it returns in `error`.
    ///
    /// ```objc
    ///    NSError *error = nil;
    ///    NSDataDetector *detector = [NSDataDetector dataDetectorWithTypes:NSTextCheckingTypeLink|NSTextCheckingTypePhoneNumber
    ///                                                               error:&error];
    /// ```
    ///
    /// After creating the data detector instance, you can determine the number of matches within a range of a string using the `NSRegularExpression` method [`numberOfMatchesInString:options:range:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsregularexpression/numberofmatches(in:options:range:)).
    ///
    /// ```objc
    ///    NSUInteger numberOfMatches = [detector numberOfMatchesInString:string
    ///                                                           options:0
    ///                                                             range:NSMakeRange(0, [string length])];
    /// ```
    ///
    /// If you’re interested only in the overall range of the first match, the [`numberOfMatchesInString:options:range:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsregularexpression/numberofmatches(in:options:range:)) method provides it.  However, with data detectors, this is less likely than with regular expressions because clients are usually interested in additional information as well.
    ///
    /// The additional information available depends on the type of the result.  For results of type [`NSTextCheckingTypeLink`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstextcheckingresult/checkingtype/link), it’s the `URL` property that’s significant.  For results of type `NSTextCheckingTypePhoneNumber` , it’s the `phoneNumber` property instead.
    ///
    /// The [`matchesInString:options:range:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsregularexpression/matches(in:options:range:)) method is similar to [`firstMatchInString:options:range:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsregularexpression/firstmatch(in:options:range:)), except that it returns all matches rather than only the first. The following code fragment finds all the matches for links and phone numbers in a string:
    ///
    /// ```objc
    ///    NSArray *matches = [detector matchesInString:string
    ///                                         options:0
    ///                                           range:NSMakeRange(0, [string length])];
    ///    for (NSTextCheckingResult *match in matches) {
    ///         NSRange matchRange = [match range];
    ///         if ([match resultType] == NSTextCheckingTypeLink) {
    ///             NSURL *url = [match URL];
    ///         } else if ([match resultType] == NSTextCheckingTypePhoneNumber) {
    ///             NSString *phoneNumber = [match phoneNumber];
    ///         }
    ///    }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The `NSRegularExpression` block object enumerator is the most general and flexible of the matching methods.  It allows you to iterate through matches in a string, performing arbitrary actions on each as specified by the code in the block, and to stop partway through if desired. In the following code fragment, the iteration stops after finding a certain number of matches:
    ///
    /// ```objc
    ///    __block NSUInteger count = 0;
    ///    [detector enumerateMatchesInString:string
    ///                               options:0
    ///                                 range:NSMakeRange(0, [string length])
    ///                            usingBlock:^(NSTextCheckingResult *match, NSMatchingFlags flags, BOOL *stop){
    ///         NSRange matchRange = [match range];
    ///         if ([match resultType] == NSTextCheckingTypeLink) {
    ///             NSURL *url = [match URL];
    ///         } else if ([match resultType] == NSTextCheckingTypePhoneNumber) {
    ///             NSString *phoneNumber = [match phoneNumber];
    ///         }
    ///         if (++count >= 100) *stop = YES;
    ///    }];
    /// ```
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Note
    ///  Only use `NSDataDetector` on natural language text.
    ///
    /// If you expect text to be in a particular format, use an [`NSFormatter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/formatter) or [`NSValueTransformer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/valuetransformer) subclass instead. For instance, if you’re expecting a date field to be an ISO 8601 timestamp, use [`NSDateFormatter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dateformatter) to parse that into an [`NSDate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdate) object.
    ///
    /// If the text is in a machine-readable format, such as XML or JSON, extract the natural language text, such as by using [`NSXMLParser`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/xmlparser) or [`NSJSONSerialization`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsonserialization), and match on that rather than attempt to match on the entire document.
