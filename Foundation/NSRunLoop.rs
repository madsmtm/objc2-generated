    ///
    /// A [`NSRunLoop`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/runloop) object processes input for sources, such as mouse and keyboard events from the window system and [`NSPort`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/port) objects. A [`NSRunLoop`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/runloop) object also processes [`NSTimer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/timer) events.
    ///
    /// Your application neither creates nor explicitly manages [`NSRunLoop`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/runloop) objects. The system creates a [`NSRunLoop`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/runloop) object as needed for each [`NSThread`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/thread) object, including the application’s main thread. If you need to access the current thread’s run loop, use the class method [`currentRunLoop`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/runloop/current).
    ///
    /// Note that from the perspective of [`NSRunLoop`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/runloop), [`NSTimer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/timer) objects aren’t “input”—they’re a special type, and they don’t cause the run loop to return when they fire.

    /// ### Warning
    ///  The [`NSRunLoop`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/runloop) class is generally not thread-safe, and you must call its methods only within the context of the current thread. Don’t call the methods of a [`NSRunLoop`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/runloop) object running in a different thread, which might cause unexpected results.
