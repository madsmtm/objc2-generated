    /// The type for representing grammatical gender in localized text.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Many languages rely on gender for their grammar. Without knowing the subject’s gender or pronoun preferences, some localized strings may have grammatical errors, resulting in a poor user experience.
    ///
    /// `TermOfAddress` is a type that enables the system to make pronoun substitutions in localized text based on gender. You don’t create instances of this type directly. Instead, use the predefined types to specify the gender to use when referring to people in translated text. Or define your own pronoun terms for a specific language when the predefined types are insufficient.
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Note
    ///  Not all terms of address exist in all languages.
    ///
    ///
    ///
    /// </div>
    /// For example, to substitute the masculine pronoun _He_, for the neutral pronoun _They_, do the following:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // Define the resource you want to apply grammatical agreement to.
    /// let resource = LocalizedStringResource("^[They](referentConcept: 1) liked your post.")
    ///
    /// // Set the inflection concept to use a term of address.
    /// var options = AttributedString.LocalizationOptions()
    /// options.concepts = [.termsOfAddress([.masculine])]
    ///
    /// // Make a new string imposing grammatical agreement on the resource from the term of address.
    /// let result = AttributedString(localized: resource, options: options)
    /// // result == "He liked your post."
    /// ```
    ///
    /// If the [`masculine`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstermofaddress/masculine), [`feminine`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstermofaddress/feminine), and [`neutral`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nstermofaddress/neutral) terms of address are insufficient, create your own term of address specifying the pronouns and language.
