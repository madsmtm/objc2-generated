    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// In Swift, this object bridges to [`AffineTransform`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/affinetransform); use [`NSAffineTransform`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsaffinetransform) when you need reference semantics or other Foundation-specific behavior.
    ///
    /// A transformation specifies how points in one coordinate system are transformed to points in another coordinate system. An affine transformation is a special type of transformation that preserves parallel lines in a path but does not necessarily preserve lengths or angles. Scaling, rotation, and translation are the most commonly used manipulations supported by affine transforms, but shearing is also possible.
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Note
    ///  In OS X 10.3 and earlier the [`NSAffineTransform`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsaffinetransform) class was declared and implemented entirely in the Application Kit framework. As of macOS 10.4 the [`NSAffineTransform`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsaffinetransform) class has been split across the Foundation and Application Kit frameworks.
    ///
    ///
    ///
    /// </div>
    /// Methods for applying affine transformations to the current graphics context and a method for applying an affine transformation to an [`NSBezierPath`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsbezierpath) object are described in NSAffineTransform Additions Reference in the Application Kit.
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Important
    ///  The Swift overlay to the Foundation framework provides the [`AffineTransform`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/affinetransform) structure, which bridges to the [`NSAffineTransform`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsaffinetransform) class.
