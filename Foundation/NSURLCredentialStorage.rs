    /// The manager of a shared credentials cache.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The shared cache stores and retrieves instances of [`NSURLCredential`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcredential). You can store password-based credentials permanently, based on the [`NSURLCredentialPersistence`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcredential/persistence-swift.enum) they were created with. Certificate-based credentials are never stored permanently.
    ///
    /// ### Subclassing notes
    ///
    /// The [`NSURLCredentialStorage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcredentialstorage) class is meant to be used as-is, but you can subclass it if you have specific needs, such as screening which credentials are stored.
    ///
    /// When overriding methods of this class, be aware that methods that take a `task` parameter are preferred to equivalent methods that do not. Therefore, you should override the task-based methods when subclassing, as follows:
    ///
    /// - Setting credentials — Override [`setCredential:forProtectionSpace:task:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcredentialstorage/set(_:for:task:)) instead of or in addition to [`setCredential:forProtectionSpace:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcredentialstorage/set(_:for:)).
    ///
    /// - Getting credentials — Override [`getCredentialsForProtectionSpace:task:completionHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcredentialstorage/getcredentials(for:task:completionhandler:)) instead of or in addition to [`credentialsForProtectionSpace:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcredentialstorage/credentials(for:)).
    ///
    /// - Removing credentials — Override [`removeCredential:forProtectionSpace:options:task:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcredentialstorage/remove(_:for:options:task:)) instead of or in addition to [`removeCredential:forProtectionSpace:options:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcredentialstorage/remove(_:for:options:)) and [`removeCredential:forProtectionSpace:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcredentialstorage/remove(_:for:)).
    ///
    /// - Setting default credentials — Override [`setDefaultCredential:forProtectionSpace:task:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcredentialstorage/setdefaultcredential(_:for:task:)) instead of or in addition to [`setDefaultCredential:forProtectionSpace:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcredentialstorage/setdefaultcredential(_:for:)).
    ///
    /// - Getting default credentials — Override [`getDefaultCredentialForProtectionSpace:task:completionHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcredentialstorage/getdefaultcredential(for:task:completionhandler:)) instead of or in addition to [`defaultCredentialForProtectionSpace:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlcredentialstorage/defaultcredential(for:)).
