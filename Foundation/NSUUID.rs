    /// A universally unique value that can be used to identify types, interfaces, and other items.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// In Swift, this object bridges to [`UUID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuuid/uuid); use [`NSUUID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuuid) when you need reference semantics or other Foundation-specific behavior.
    ///
    /// UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers), also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers) or IIDs (Interface Identifiers), are 128-bit values. UUIDs created by `NSUUID` conform to RFC 4122 version 4 and are created with random bytes.
    ///
    /// The standard format for UUIDs represented in ASCII is a string punctuated by hyphens, for example `68753A44-4D6F-1226-9C60-0050E4C00067`. The hex representation looks, as you might expect, like a list of numerical values preceded by 0x. For example, `0xD7`, `0x36`, `0x95`, `0x0A`, `0x4D`, `0x6E`, `0x12`, `0x26`, `0x80`, `0x3A`, `0x00`, `0x50`, `0xE4`, `0xC0`, `0x00`, `0x67`. Because a UUID is expressed simply as an array of bytes, there are no endianness considerations for different platforms.
    ///
    /// The `NSUUID` class is _not_ toll-free bridged with CoreFoundation’s [`CFUUIDRef`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfuuid). Use UUID strings to convert between `CFUUIDRef` and `NSUUID`, if needed. Two `NSUUID` objects are not guaranteed to be comparable by pointer value (as [`CFUUIDRef`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfuuid) is); use [`isEqual:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobjectprotocol/isequal(_:)) to compare two `NSUUID` instances.
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Important
    ///  The Swift overlay to the Foundation framework provides the [`UUID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuuid/uuid) structure, which bridges to the [`NSUUID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuuid) class.
