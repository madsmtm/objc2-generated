    /// A request that produces a floating-point number that represents the capture quality of a face in a photo.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// This request produces or updates a [`VNFaceObservation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/vnfaceobservation) object’s property [`faceCaptureQuality`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/vnfaceobservation/facecapturequality-bjg5) with a floating-point value. The value ranges from `0` to `1`. Faces with quality closer to `1` are better lit, sharper, and more centrally positioned than faces with quality closer to `0`.
    ///
    /// If you don’t execute the request, or the request fails, the property [`faceCaptureQuality`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/vnfaceobservation/facecapturequality-bjg5) is [`nil`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nil-227m0).
    ///
    ///
    /// A request that will produce or update a VNFaceObservation's property faceCaptureQuality with a float value.
    /// faceCaptureQuality is a float (wrapped by a NSNumber) that represents the capture quality of a given face in a photo.
    /// The float will be a value between 0 and 1, with 1 being the highest face capture quality and 0 being the lowest.
    /// If the request fails or the face observation has never been processed, the property faceCaptureQuality will be nil.
    ///
    ///
    /// This request will generate VNFaceObservation objects with the face quality variable populated with information .
