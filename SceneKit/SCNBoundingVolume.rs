    /// Methods common to the [`SCNNode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scnnode) and [`SCNGeometry`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scngeometry) classes for measuring location and size.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// This protocol defines features adopted by both the [`SCNNode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scnnode) and [`SCNGeometry`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scngeometry) classes.
    ///
    /// A bounding box is the smallest volume, in the shape of a rectangle aligned to the axes of the local coordinate space, that entirely contains an object. Scene Kit defines a bounding box using two points: a minimum and maximum corner. Similarly, a bounding sphere is the smallest sphere containing an object.
    ///
    /// By default, Scene Kit automatically determines the minimal bounding volumes for geometries based on their vertex positions in model space. The bounding volume of a node with an attached geometry is the bounding volume of the geometry, expressed in the node’s local space. The bounding volume of a node containing child nodes is the minimal volume that encloses the bounding volumes of the node’s children.
    ///
    /// Scene Kit uses the bounding volume of an object when determining how to render a scene. For example, an [`SCNCamera`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scncamera) object uses the bounding boxes of visible elements in a scene to determine the its depth limits. You can override a bounding volume to change this behavior. For example, if a building model has a long, narrow antenna, the default bounding box includes that feature, so the default camera view for that model will be off-center with respect to the building itself. If you set a new bounding box that includes only the main part of the building, the default camera view will center on the building and ignore the antenna.
    ///
    /// ### Getting and Setting Bounding Volumes
    ///
    /// Read the [`boundingBox`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scnboundingvolume/boundingbox) or [`boundingSphere`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scnboundingvolume/boundingsphere) property, [`getBoundingBoxMin:max:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scnboundingvolume/getboundingboxmin:max:) or [`getBoundingSphereCenter:radius:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scnboundingvolume/getboundingspherecenter:radius:) methods in Objective-C, to retrieve information about an object’s bounding box or sphere. To override the automatically determined bounding volume of an object, set a new value for the [`boundingBox`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scnboundingvolume/boundingbox) property, the [`setBoundingBoxMin:max:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scnboundingvolume/setboundingboxmin:max:) method in Objective-C.
