///
/// ```objc

///     if (status >= SCNSceneSourceStatusProcessing && status < SCNSceneSourceStatusComplete)

/// };
/// ```
///
///
/// Represents a phase of the loading process.
///
/// Each of these constants (except SCNSceneSourceStatusError) represents a phase of the loading process. "Parsing" means that the document is being deserialized, "validating" that it's being checked for consistency, "processing" that the resulting object is being loaded. New values might be added to this enumeration to make it more detailed; however the values will always be ordered in the same order as the corresponding phases are executed.

/// - totalProgress: A floating-point number between `0.0` and `1.0` indicating the overall progress of loading the scene. A value of `0.0` indicates that the loading process has just begun, and a value of `1.0` indicates that the process has completed.

///
/// - error: An error object describing any error that has occurred during scene loading, or `nil` if no errors has been encountered.
///
/// - stopLoading: A reference to a Boolean value. Set `*stop` to [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) within the block to abort further processing of the scene source’s contents.
