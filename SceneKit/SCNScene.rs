///
/// - totalProgress: A number between `0.0` and `1.0` that indicates the progress of the export operation, with `0.0` indicating that the operation has just begun and `1.0` indicating the operation has completed.
///

/// - stop: Set `*stop` to [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) inside the block to cancel export.
///
///
/// Signature of a block that will be called repeatedly while the scene is being exported.
///
/// Parameter `totalProgress`: is a floating-point number between 0 and 1. 0 means the loading process has just started and 1 that it is complete.

    /// ### Creating a Scene
    ///
    /// The simplest way to create a scene is through Xcode’s SceneKit Scene Editor. Start by importing one or more assets from a 3D editor, such as Blender. Then you adjust the positions and attributes of the assets, and set global scene properties, such as lighting environment, to compose your scene. The scene editor creates a `.scn` file, which you save to a `.scnassets` folder in the app bundle. When you build your project, Xcode optimizes the scene file for your target platform.
