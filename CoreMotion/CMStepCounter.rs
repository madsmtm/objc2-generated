/// - `numberOfSteps`: The number of steps that occurred between the start and end times specified by the query.
///
/// - `error`: An error object indicating that there was a problem gathering the data or `nil` if the number of steps was determined correctly.

/// ## Discussion

///
/// - `numberOfSteps`: The total number of steps since the [`startStepCountingUpdatesToQueue:updateOn:withHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmstepcounter/startstepcountingupdates(to:updateon:withhandler:)) method was called.
///
/// - `timestamp`: The time at which the current step count was reported.
///
/// - `error`: An error object indicating that there was a problem gathering the data or `nil` if the number of steps was determined correctly.
