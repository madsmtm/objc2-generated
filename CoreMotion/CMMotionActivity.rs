    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// On devices that support motion, you can use a [`CMMotionActivityManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmmotionactivitymanager) or [`CMHeadphoneActivityManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmheadphoneactivitymanager) object to request updates when the current type of motion changes. When a change occurs, the update information is packaged into a [`CMMotionActivity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmmotionactivity) object and sent to your app.
    ///
    /// The motion-related properties of this class aren’t mutually exclusive. In other words, it’s possible for more than one of the motion-related properties to contain the value [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true). For example, if the user was driving in a car and the car stopped at a red light, the update event associated with that change in motion would have both the [`automotive`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmmotionactivity/automotive) and [`stationary`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmmotionactivity/stationary) properties set to [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true). It’s also possible for all of the properties to be set to [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) when the device is in motion but the movement doesn’t correlate to walking, running, cycling, or automotive travel.
    ///
    /// You don’t create instances of this class yourself. The [`CMMotionActivityManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmmotionactivitymanager) object creates them and sends them to the handler block you registered. For more information about how to initiate the delivery of motion activity updates to your app, see [`CMMotionActivityManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmmotionactivitymanager).
