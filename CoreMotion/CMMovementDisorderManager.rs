    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Dyskinesias are uncontrolled, involuntary movements that occur as a side effect of taking Levadopa to control Parkinson’s disease. Dyskinesias can manifest in a single body part, such as the arm, leg, or head, or they can affect the entire body. Particular dyskinesias resemble actions like fidgeting, writhing, wriggling, head bobbing, or body swaying. These symptoms tend to occur during the drug’s peak dosage. Dyskinesias typically occur in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease, who may require higher dosages of Levadopa.
