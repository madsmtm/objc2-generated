    /// The [`SKPaymentDiscount`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skpaymentdiscount) contains the details of a promotional offer discount that you want to apply to a [`SKMutablePayment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skmutablepayment).

    /// Include the signature that you generated in this object. For guidance, see [Generating a signature for promotional offers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/generating-a-signature-for-promotional-offers). The App Store uses this signature and the parameters to validate the promotional offer. Keep in mind that the signature must correspond to the parameters in the payment for a transaction to be successful.
