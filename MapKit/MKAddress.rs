    ///
    /// MapKit capabilities, such as Search and Reverse geocoding, populate the [`MKAddress`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkaddress) of a [`MKMapItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkmapitem) with a full address, and a short address, if the framework has one.
    ///
    /// When presenting a Place Card using an [`MKMapItemDetailViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkmapitemdetailviewcontroller) or a selection accessory on an annotation you created using an [`MKMapItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkmapitem), MapKit uses the full address provided if you create the `MKMapitem` using [`initWithLocation:address:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkmapitem/init(location:address:)).
