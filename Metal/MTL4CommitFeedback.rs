/// ## Discussion
///
/// You register a commit feedback block with Metal by providing an instance of [`MTL4CommitOptions`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtl4commitoptions) to the command queue’s commit method, [`commit:count:options:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtl4commandqueue/commit:count:options:). The commit options instance references your commit feedback handler after you add it via its [`addFeedbackHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtl4commitoptions/addfeedbackhandler(_:)) method.
