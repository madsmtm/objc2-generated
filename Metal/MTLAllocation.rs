    /// A memory allocation from a Metal GPU device, such as a memory heap, texture, or data buffer.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Types that conform to [`MTLAllocation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlallocation), including [`MTLBuffer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlbuffer), [`MTLTexture`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtltexture), and [`MTLHeap`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlheap), have underlying memory. You make their memory _resident_, or GPU-accessible, by adding an allocation to an [`MTLResidencySet`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlresidencyset) or calling the appropriate method of a command encoder.
    ///
    /// See [Simplifying GPU resource management with residency sets](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/simplifying-gpu-resource-management-with-residency-sets) for more information.

    /// Base class for Metal allocations.
    ///
    /// This protocol provides a common interface for adding Metal resources to ``MTLResidencySet`` instances. Call
    /// ``MTLResidencySet/addAllocation:`` to add a Metal resource allocation to a residency set.
