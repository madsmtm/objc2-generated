/// A type that represents one, two, or three dimensions of a type instance, such as an array or texture.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// Metal has many types that represent arrays of discrete elements, such as:
///
/// - A texture, which has an array of pixel elements
///
/// - A thread grid, which has an array of computational threads
///
/// Types and methods that work with these array-like types frequently have an [`MTLSize`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlsize) property or parameter that refers to the extents of a specific instance of the type, or a region within the instance.
///
/// <div class="warning">
///
/// ### Important
/// Treat each size instance as a measure of something in 3D, even if it represents something with only one or two dimensions, by assigning `1` to the irrelevant dimensions.
///
///
///
/// </div>
/// The following are some examples for setting a size for an instance that has less than three dimentions:
///
/// - For a 2D texture that has a height and width of `5`, set a size’s [`depth`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlsize/depth) property to `1` so that it represents `[5, 5, 1]`.
///
/// - For a 1D array with length `42`, set a size’s [`height`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlsize/height), [`depth`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlsize/depth) properties to `1`, so that it represents `[42, 1, 1]`.

/// A set of dimensions to declare the size of an object, such as an image, texture, threadgroup, or grid.

///

For a 2D instance, set the z coordinate of the origin to `0` and the depth to `1`. For a 1D instance, set the y and z coordinates of the origin to `0` and the height and depth to `1`.
