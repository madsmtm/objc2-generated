    /// An instance you use to create, submit, and schedule command buffers to a specific GPU device to run the commands within those buffers.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// A command queue maintains an ordered list of command buffers. You use a command queue to:
    ///
    /// - Create command buffers, which you fill with commands for the GPU device that creates the queue
    ///
    /// - Submit command buffers to run on that GPU
    ///
    /// Create a command queue from an [`MTLDevice`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtldevice) instance by calling its [`newCommandQueue`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtldevice/makecommandqueue()) or [`newCommandQueueWithMaxCommandBufferCount:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtldevice/makecommandqueue(maxcommandbuffercount:)) method. Typically, you create one or more command queues when your app launches and then keep them throughout your app’s lifetime.
    ///
    /// With each [`MTLCommandQueue`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcommandqueue) instance you create, you can create [`MTLCommandBuffer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcommandbuffer) instances for that queue by calling its [`commandBuffer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcommandqueue/makecommandbuffer()) or [`commandBufferWithUnretainedReferences`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcommandqueue/makecommandbufferwithunretainedreferences()) method.
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Note
    ///  Each command queue is thread-safe and allows you to encode commands in multiple command buffers simultaneously.
    ///
    ///
    ///
