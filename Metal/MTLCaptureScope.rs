    /// A type that can programmatically customize a GPU frame capture.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Each capture scope instance configures what a frame capture records and methods that programmatically start and stop recording data.
    ///
    /// Filter the commands a frame capture records by selecting specific sources with a capture scope. By contrast, the default capture scope records all the data for a single frame when you click the Capture GPU workload button in the debug bar in Xcode. You can choose which data Metal records during a frame capture by creating your own capture scope.
    ///
    /// You can program exactly which Metal commands to record in a frame capture by calling the [`beginScope`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcapturescope/begin()) and [`endScope`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcapturescope/end()) methods around the Metal calls you want the capture to include. In the case of a rendering loop, your calls to [`beginScope`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcapturescope/begin()) and [`endScope`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlcapturescope/end()) can capture a small part of a frame, or capture data from multiple frames.
    ///
    /// For more information about frame captures and capture scopes, see [Metal debugger](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/metal-debugger) and [Metal developer workflows](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/metal-developer-workflows), respectively.
