    /// A controller profile that supported the DualSense controller.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The DualSense controller profile is similar to a DualShock profile ([`GCDualShockGamepad`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller/gcdualshockgamepad)), but has adaptive triggers that allow you to specify a dynamic resistance force when the user pulls the trigger. For example, you can emulate the feeling of pulling back a bow string, firing a weapon, or pulling a lever.
    ///
    /// This profile also supports motion — that is, the controller’s [`motion`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller/gccontroller/motion) property is non-nil. If you hold the controller in front of you, the direction of the axes are:
    ///
    /// - The positive x-axis points to your right.
    ///
    /// - The positive y-axis points up out of the USB-C port.
    ///
    /// - The positive z-axis starts at the touchpad and points to you.
    ///
    ///
    /// The GCDualSenseGamepad profile represents any supported DualSense controller.
    ///
    ///
    /// See: GCExtendedGamepad
    ///
