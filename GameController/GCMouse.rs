    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// To get a mouse object and its input values, register for the [`GCMouseDidConnect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsnotification/name-swift.struct/gcmousedidconnect) (Swift) or [`GCMouseDidConnectNotification`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller/gcmousedidconnectnotification) (Objective-C) notification for when a mouse connects to the device. Then register for the [`GCMouseDidBecomeCurrent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsnotification/name-swift.struct/gcmousedidbecomecurrent)  (Swift) or [`GCMouseDidBecomeCurrentNotification`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller/gcmousedidbecomecurrentnotification) (Objective-C) notification for when it becomes the [`current`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller/gcmouse/current) mouse. Alternatively, use the [`current`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller/gcmouse/current) class property or the [`mice`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller/gcmouse/mice()) class method to get a mouse object. Then get the current input values from the mouse object’s [`mouseInput`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller/gcmouse/mouseinput) controller profile.
