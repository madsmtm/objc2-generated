    /// A profile that supports only the directional pad, without motion or rotation.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The directional gamepad profile is similar to a micro gamepad profile except it doesn’t support motion or rotation. The controller’s [`motion`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller/gccontroller/motion) property is `nil` and the inherited [`allowsRotation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller/gcmicrogamepad/allowsrotation) property is [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false).
    ///
    /// If you select Micro Gamepad when you add the Game Controllers capability ([`GCSupportedGameControllers`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/gcsupportedgamecontrollers) ) to your project, and you also support the GCDirectionalGamepad profile, select Directional Gamepad as well.
    ///
    /// If you support the second-generation Siri Remote and later, set the [`GCSupportsMultipleMicroGamepads`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/gcsupportsmultiplemicrogamepads) key to `YES` in the information property list in your project.
    ///
    /// In addition, the directional pad element may report digital or analog values. If the directional pad’s [`analog`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller/gccontrollerelement/isanalog) property is [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), it reports absolute directional pad values (the [`reportsAbsoluteDpadValues`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller/gcmicrogamepad/reportsabsolutedpadvalues) property is [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true)).
    ///
    ///
    /// Directional Gamepad profile.
    ///
    /// All controller profiles provide a base level of information about the controller they belong to. A directional gamepad
    /// features a subset of the possible inputs on a micro gamepad. It guarantees:
    /// - The gamepad does not support motion, meaning
    /// - -[GCController motion] is always nil
    /// - -[GCDirectionalGamepad allowsRotation] is always NO
    ///
    /// Additionally, the gamepad may have a digital or analog dpad.
    /// - -[GCDirectionalGamepad dpad].analog may be YES or NO
    /// - If -[GCDirectionalGamepad dpad].analog is NO, then -[GCDirectionalGamepad reportsAbsoluteDpadValues] is always YES
    ///
    /// A profile maps the hardware notion of a controller into a logical controller. One that a developer can design for
    /// and depend on, no matter the underlying hardware. If your game supports GCMicroGamepad, but does not need
    /// the motion and analog dpad functionality of GCMicroGamepad, be sure to add Directional Gamepad to your project's
    /// supported Game Controller capabilities.
    ///
    ///
    /// See: GCMicroGamepad
    ///
    ///
    /// Note: If you want to use the additional functionality of GCDirectionalGamepad, you should set GCSupportsMultipleMicroGamepads to YES and handle microgamepad connections separately.
    ///
    ///
    /// Note: This profile represents the 2021 2nd generation Siri Remote. Make sure you set GCSupportsMultipleMicroGamepads to YES to properly support the remote.
