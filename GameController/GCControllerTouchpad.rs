///
/// - yValue: A normalized value of the y-axis touch location ranging from `-1` to `1`.

/// - buttonPressed: A Boolean value that indicates whether the user is pressing the touchpad button. If [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), the user is pressing the button; otherwise, the user isn’t.
