/// Parameters:
/// - gamepad: The profile with the element value that changes.
///
/// - element: The element with the value that changes in the profile.
///
/// Set this block if you want to be notified when a value on a element changed. If multiple elements have changed this block will be called
/// for each element that changed. As elements in a collection, such as the axis in a dpad, tend to change at the same time and thus
/// will only call this once with the collection as the element.
///
///
/// Parameter `gamepad`: this gamepad that is being used to map the raw input data into logical values on controller elements such as the dpad or the buttons.
///
/// Parameter `element`: the element that has been modified.
