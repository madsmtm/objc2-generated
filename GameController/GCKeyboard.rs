    /// To get the keyboard object and its input values, register for the [`GCKeyboardDidConnect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsnotification/name-swift.struct/gckeyboarddidconnect) (Swift) or [`GCKeyboardDidConnectNotification`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller/gckeyboarddidconnectnotification) (Objective-C) notification for when a keyboard connects to the device, or use the [`coalescedKeyboard`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller/gckeyboard/coalesced) class property.
