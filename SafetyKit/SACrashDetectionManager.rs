    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Use this class to determine Crash Detection availabilty on iPhone, detect authorization status, and register for Crash Detection events. Not all iPhones support Crash Detection, so verify that [`available`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safetykit/sacrashdetectionmanager/isavailable) returns [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true).
    ///
    /// Check the value of [`authorizationStatus`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safetykit/sacrashdetectionmanager/authorizationstatus) to determine if the person designates this app on their iPhone to receive Crash Detection events. If the value is not [`SAAuthorizationStatusAuthorized`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safetykit/saauthorizationstatus/authorized), set [`delegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safetykit/sacrashdetectionmanager/delegate) and call [`requestAuthorizationWithCompletionHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safetykit/sacrashdetectionmanager/requestauthorization(completionhandler:)) to request authorization.
    ///
    /// After your app has authorization to receive Crash Detection events, adopt [`SACrashDetectionDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safetykit/sacrashdetectiondelegate) and implement [`crashDetectionManager:didDetectEvent:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safetykit/sacrashdetectiondelegate/crashdetectionmanager(_:diddetect:)). If a vehicular crash occurs, the system calls the method with the Crash Detection event.
