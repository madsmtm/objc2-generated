    /// A sample that groups multiple related samples into a single entry.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// HealthKit uses correlations to represent both blood pressure and food.
    ///
    /// - Blood pressure correlations always include two quantity samples, representing the systolic and diastolic values.
    ///
    /// - Food correlations can contain a wide range of dietary information about the food, including information about the fat, protein, carbohydrates, energy, and vitamins consumed.
    ///
    /// In general, a food correlation should include at least a [`HKQuantityTypeIdentifierDietaryEnergyConsumed`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkquantitytypeidentifier/dietaryenergyconsumed) sample. You can also add nutritional quantity samples for any other items you want to track. Use the [`HKMetadataKeyFoodType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkmetadatakeyfoodtype) key to indicate the food’s name.
    ///
    /// The [`HKCorrelation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkcorrelation) class is a concrete subclass of the [`HKSample`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hksample) class. Correlations are immutable: You set the correlation’s properties when the object is first created, and they cannot change.
    ///
    /// ### Extend Correlation Samples
    ///
    /// Like many HealthKit classes, the `HKCorrelation` class should not be subclassed. You can extend the correlation class by adding metadata with custom keys as appropriate for your app.
    ///
    /// For more information, see the [`correlationWithType:startDate:endDate:objects:metadata:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkcorrelation/init(type:start:end:objects:metadata:)) method.
    ///
    ///
    /// An HKCorrelation is a collection of correlated objects.
    ///
    /// When multiple readings are taken together, it may be beneficial to correlate them so that they can be
    /// displayed together and share common metadata about how they were created.
    ///
    /// For example, systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings are typically presented together so these
    /// readings should be saved with a correlation of type blood pressure.
