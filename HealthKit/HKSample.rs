    /// A HealthKit sample represents a piece of data associated with a start and end time.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The `HKSample` class is an abstract class. You should never instantiate a `HKSample` object directly. Instead, you always work with one of its concrete subclasses: [`HKCategorySample`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkcategorysample), [`HKQuantitySample`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkquantitysample), [`HKCorrelation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkcorrelation), or [`HKWorkout`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkout) classes.
    ///
    /// HealthKit samples are all immutable: You set the sample’s properties when you create it, and they cannot change.
    ///
    /// If the sample represents data over a duration, the start time must be earlier than the end time. If the sample represents data at a particular instant, the start and end times can be the same.
    ///
    ///
    /// An abstract class representing measurements taken over a period of time.
