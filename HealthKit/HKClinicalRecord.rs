    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The clinical record stores information about a single condition, procedure, or result. While the record’s properties expose some high-level information, the  [`FHIRResource`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkclinicalrecord/fhirresource) property contains the underlying data from the user’s healthcare institution.
    ///
    /// Note that the record inherits the [`HKSample`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hksample) class’s [`startDate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hksample/startdate) and [`endDate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hksample/enddate) properties. However, the system does not populate these properties with information from the FHIR data; instead, the [`startDate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hksample/startdate) and [`endDate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hksample/enddate) reflect the time and date when the system downloaded the FHIR data to the device.
    ///
    ///
    /// An HKObject subclass representing a health record.
    ///
    /// The startDate and endDate properties (inherited from HKSample) are set to the date the sample was
    /// added to Health. Unlike other HKObject subclasses, UUID is not a stable identifier
    /// for a given sample. Use a combination of HKSource, FHIRResource.resourceType, and
    /// FHIRResource.identifier instead.
