    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The [`HKSourceRevision`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hksourcerevision) class acts as a wrapper for the [`HKSource`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hksource) class, adding information about the source’s version, operating system, and product type.
    ///
    /// Source revision objects are immutable: you set the source revision’s properties when you create the object, and they cannot change.
    ///
    /// When an [`HKObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkobject) instance is created, its [`sourceRevision`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkobject/sourcerevision) property is set to `nil`. When the object is saved to the HealthKit store, HealthKit assigns a new source revision to the object’s [`sourceRevision`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkobject/sourcerevision) property. The source revision can be accessed only on objects retrieved from the HealthKit store.
    ///
    /// ### Subclassing Source Revisions
    ///
    /// Like many HealthKit classes, the [`HKSourceRevision`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hksourcerevision) class is not extensible and should not be subclassed.
    ///
    ///
    /// Represents a specific revision of an HKSource.
