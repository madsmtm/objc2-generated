    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// To access the attachment’s data, get a data reader from the attachment store for each attachment.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// let attachmentStore = HKAttachmentStore(healthStore: store)
    ///
    /// let attachments: [HKAttachment]
    /// do {
    ///     attachments = try await attachmentStore.attachments(for: prescription)
    /// } catch {
    ///     // Handle the error here.
    ///     fatalError("*** An error occurred while accessing the attachments for a prescription: \(error.localizedDescription) ***")
    /// }
    ///
    /// // Use the attachments here.
    /// print("*** \(attachments.count) attachments found ***")
    ///
    /// for attachment in attachments {
    ///
    ///     // Get a data reader for the attachment.
    ///     let dataReader = attachmentStore.dataReader(for:   attachment)
    ///
    ///     // Read the data here.
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// You can then asynchronously access the whole data object.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// let data: Data
    /// do {
    ///     data = try await dataReader.data
    /// } catch {
    ///     // Handle the error here.
    ///     fatalError("*** An error occurred while accessing the attachment's data. \(error.localizedDescription) ***")
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Alternatively, you can access the file’s contents as an asynchronous sequence of bytes.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // Asynchronously access the attachment's bytes.
    /// var data = Data()
    /// do {
    ///     for try await byte in dataReader.bytes {
    ///         // Use the bytes here.
    ///         data.append(byte)
    ///     }
    /// } catch {
    ///     // Handle the error here.
    ///     fatalError("*** An error occurred while reading the attachment's data: \(error.localizedDescription) ***")
    /// }

    ///  You can only add attachments to [`HKVisionPrescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkvisionprescription), [`HKGlassesPrescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkglassesprescription), and [`HKContactsPrescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkcontactsprescription) samples.
