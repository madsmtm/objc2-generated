    /// An abstract class that represents a health document in the HealthKit store.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// You should never instantiate an `HKDocumentSample` object directly. Instead, you always work with a concrete subclass. In iOS 10 and watchOS 3, the only concrete class is the [`HKCDADocumentSample`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkcdadocumentsample) class.
    ///
    /// Document samples are immutable: You set the sample’s properties when you create it, and they cannot change.
    ///
    /// ### Extend Document Samples
    ///
    /// Like many HealthKit classes, you should not create any custom subclasses of the `HKDocumentSample` class. You can extend the `HKDocumentSample` class and its subclasses by adding custom metadata keys and values to the metadata dictionary when the object is instantiated.
    ///
