    /// An object that describes an activity within a longer workout.

    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Workout activity objects partition a workout into a set of separate activities. For example, you can use workout activities to record the swim, bike, and running portions of a multisport event, like a triathlon, or to represent the active and rest periods during interval training. All [`HKWorkout`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkout) instance have at least one, associated [`HKWorkoutActivity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutactivity). If you don’t explicitly set workout activities, HealthKit assigns a workout activity that matches the [`HKWorkout`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkout) object’s activity type. For more information, see [Dividing a HealthKit workout into activities](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/dividing-a-healthkit-workout-into-activities).
