    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Use a [`HKHeartbeatSeriesQuery`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkheartbeatseriesquery) to access the underlying heartbeat data.
    ///
    /// The [`HKHeartbeatSeriesSample`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkheartbeatseriessample) class is a subclass of the [`HKSeriesSample`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkseriessample) class. These samples are immutable; you set the sample’s properties when you build them, and they can’t change.
    ///
    /// ### Extend Heartbeat Samples
    ///
    /// Like many HealthKit classes, you shouldn’t subclass the [`HKHeartbeatSeriesSample`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkheartbeatseriessample) class. You may extend this class by adding metadata with custom keys to save related data used by your app.
    ///
    /// For more information, see [`addMetadata:completion:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkheartbeatseriesbuilder/addmetadata(_:completion:)).
    ///
    ///
    /// An HKHeartbeatSeriesSample represents a series of heartbeats.
    ///
    /// To retrieve the underlying series data for an HKHeartbeatSeriesSample, use HKHeartbeatSeriesQuery
