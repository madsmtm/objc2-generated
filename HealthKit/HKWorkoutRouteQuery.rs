    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Use a workout route query to access the location data associated with an [`HKWorkoutRoute`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutroute). Because a route sample can include a large number of [`CLLocation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocation) objects, the query asynchronously returns the locations in batches. For detailed instructions, see `Reading Route Data`.
