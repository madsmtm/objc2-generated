    /// A sample that represents a discrete quantity.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// A quantity sample contains one or more [`HKQuantity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkquantity) objects. Each quantity represents a single piece of data with a single numeric value and the value’s associated units. Use these samples to store data representing independent measurements, such as height, heart rate, or temperature.
    ///
    /// The [`HKDiscreteQuantitySample`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkdiscretequantitysample) class is a concrete subclass of the [`HKQuantitySample`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkquantitysample) class. Discrete quantity samples are immutable; you set the sample’s properties when you create it, and they cannot change.
    ///
    /// ### Extend Discrete Quantity Samples
    ///
    /// Like many HealthKit classes, you should not subclass the [`HKDiscreteQuantitySample`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkdiscretequantitysample) class. You may extend this class by adding metadata with custom keys to save related data used by your app.
    ///
    /// For more information, see [`quantitySampleWithType:quantity:startDate:endDate:metadata:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkquantitysample/init(type:quantity:start:end:metadata:)).
    ///
    ///
    /// An HKQuantitySample subclass representing a quantity measurement with
    /// discrete aggregation style.
