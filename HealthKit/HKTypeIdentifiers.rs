    /// ## Discussion
    ///
    /// Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra can sample a person’s wrist temperature while they sleep. A supported watch measures temperature from both sensors every five seconds overnight during sleep. The watch then aggregates this data to a single [`HKQuantityTypeIdentifierAppleSleepingWristTemperature`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkquantitytypeidentifier/applesleepingwristtemperature) sample. It corrects this sample for environmental bias and calculates a single value that represents the wrist temperature over the entire night.
    ///
    /// Body temperature naturally fluctuates from night to night, and external factors, like the sleep environment, can also affect the measurements. Other factors that can affect a person’s relative temperature include exercise, jet lag, menstrual cycles, or illness.
    ///
    /// Cycle tracking uses a person’s sleeping wrist temperature data to provide a retrospective estimate of when they likely ovulated. It also combines this data with heart rate and logged cycle data to provide improved predictions about their cycle.
    ///
    /// To enable sleeping wrist temperature measurements, ensure Sleep Focus is on and that someone is wearing Apple Watch while sleeping.
    ///
    /// Apple Watch records the absolute wrist temperature value; however, Health displays this data as a relative value, based on a person’s baseline. Health needs to calculate this baseline, so it won’t display the wrist temperature until it has gathered about five nights of data. However, Apple Watch records [`HKQuantityTypeIdentifierAppleSleepingWristTemperature`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkquantitytypeidentifier/applesleepingwristtemperature) samples starting with the first night, and you can read them immediately from the HealthKit store.

    ///
    /// There are two approaches to detecting falls in your app. You can either query for [`HKQuantityTypeIdentifierNumberOfTimesFallen`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkquantitytypeidentifier/numberoftimesfallen) samples in HealthKit, or you can use Core Motion’s [`CMFallDetectionManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmfalldetectionmanager).
    ///
    /// The Core Motion fall detection manager is particularly useful for apps that need to respond to falls in a timely manner so that the app can provide help to the person who fell.
    ///
    /// The fall detection manager:
    ///
    /// - Notifies the app in real time
    ///
    /// - Notifies the app of all fall events
    ///
    /// - Provides background runtime so that your app can respond to the fall
    ///
    /// ### Detect and Monitor Falls Over Time
    ///
    /// The HealthKit sample is particularly useful for apps that monitor falls over longer time periods, because there can be a delay between the fall event and HealthKit updating its samples.
    ///
    /// HealthKit provides:
    ///
    /// - Samples that are available on all devices that can access the person’s HealthKit data—not just the device that detected the fall
    ///
    /// - Samples for falls where the person who fell confirmed the fall, or the system escalated the fall to emergency services. If the person who fell dismisses the fall alert, HealthKit doesn’t record the fall.
    ///
    /// Both Core Motion and HealthKit need to authorize access to fall detection before they receive any notifications; however, Core Motion requires an additional entitlement from Apple. To apply for the entitlement, see [Fall Detection Entitlement Request](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/fall-detection-api).
