    /// A shared content manager for controlling interactions between your media app and system-provided or external media player interfaces.

    /// ## Overview

    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Important
    ///  Some features of this class are specific to CarPlay, which requires a special entitlement issued by Apple. Apps without the correct entitlement won’t appear on the CarPlay home screen. See [http://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/](http://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/) for more information.

    /// </div>
    /// The app provides data to the content manager so that the media player can browse the content provided. A delegate provides the media player the ability to perform actions that manage the app’s playback queue.
    ///
    /// You don’t create a new content manager directly, instead you grab the shared content manager using the [`sharedContentManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpplayablecontentmanager/shared()) method. After getting the shared content manager, your next step depends on the features your app supports:
    ///
    /// - To provide content navigation and suggested content for CarPlay, immediately set both the [`dataSource`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpplayablecontentmanager/datasource) and [`delegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpplayablecontentmanager/delegate) properties. After setting these properties, use the [`beginUpdates`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpplayablecontentmanager/beginupdates()) and [`endUpdates`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpplayablecontentmanager/endupdates()) methods to load the information from the data source.
    ///
    /// - To provide suggested content when the user connects headphones, a Bluetooth stereo, or another output device, set only the [`delegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpplayablecontentmanager/delegate) property. After you set a delegate, iOS automatically calls methods in the [`MPPlayableContentDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpplayablecontentdelegate) protocol allowing you to suggest appropriate content.
    ///
    ///
    /// MPPlayableContentManager is a class that manages the interactions between a
    /// media application and an external media player interface. The application
    /// provides the content manager with a data source, which allows the media player
    /// to browse the media content offered by the application, as well as a delegate,
    /// which allows the media player to relay non-media remote playback commands to the application.
