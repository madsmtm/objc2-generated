    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// This object represents a media item such as a song, movie, radio station, or podcast episode. The media player displays the information stored in it.
    ///
    /// Update this object by changing its properties during runtime or by creating a new `MPContentItem` object with new property values, but with the same identifier as the object to change. Use the [`beginUpdates`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpplayablecontentmanager/beginupdates()) and [`endUpdates`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpplayablecontentmanager/endupdates()) methods found in [`MPPlayableContentManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpplayablecontentmanager) to update several `MPContentItem` objects at once.
