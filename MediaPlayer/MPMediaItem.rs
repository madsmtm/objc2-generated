    /// A media item has an overall unique identifier, accessed using the [`MPMediaItemPropertyPersistentID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaitempropertypersistentid) property key, as well as specific identifiers for its metadata. These identifiers persists across application launches.
    ///
    /// A media item can have a wide range of metadata associated with it. You access this metadata using the [`valueForProperty:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaentity/value(forproperty:)) method along with the property keys described in this document. You can also access metadata in a batch fashion using the [`enumerateValuesForProperties:usingBlock:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaentity/enumeratevalues(forproperties:using:)) method. Anytime the app accesses more than one property, enumerating over a set of property keys is more efficient than fetching each individual property. [`MPMediaEntity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaentity) defines both of these methods, the abstract superclass of [`MPMediaItemCollection`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaitemcollection), and described in `MPMediaEntity`.
    ///
    /// You use attributes of media items to build media queries for searching the Media library. [`MPMediaType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediatype), [General media item property keys](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/general-media-item-property-keys), and `Podcast Item Property Keys` describe these attributes. In addition, [Media entity property keys](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/media-entity-property-keys) describes the [`MPMediaEntityPropertyPersistentID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaentitypropertypersistentid) property, and [`MPMediaQuery`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpmediaquery) describes media queries.
