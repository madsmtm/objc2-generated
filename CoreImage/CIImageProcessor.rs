    /// The abstract class you extend to create custom image processors that can integrate with Core Image workflows.
    ///
    /// Unlike the ``CIKernel`` class and its other subclasses that allow you to create new image-processing effects
    /// with the Core Image Kernel Language, the `CIImageProcessorKernel` class provides direct access to the underlying
    /// bitmap image data for a step in the Core Image processing pipeline. As such, you can create subclasses of this
    /// class to integrate other image-processing technologies—such as Metal compute shaders, Metal Performance Shaders,
    /// Accelerate vImage operations, or your own CPU-based image-processing routines—with a Core Image filter chain.
    ///
    /// Your custom image processing operation is invoked by your subclassed image processor kernel's
    /// ``processWithInputs:arguments:output:error:`` method. The method can accept zero, one or more inputs.
    /// Processors  that generate imagery (such as a noise or pattern generator) need no inputs, while kernels that
    /// composite source images together require multiple inputs. The arguments dictionary allows the caller to pass in
    /// additional parameter values (such as the radius of a blur) and the output contains the destination for your
    /// image processing code to write to.
    ///
    /// ## Subclassing Notes
    ///
    /// The `CIImageProcessorKernel` class is abstract; to create a custom image processor, you define a subclass of this class.
    ///
    /// You do not directly create instances of a custom `CIImageProcessorKernel` subclass. Image processors must not carry or
    /// use state specific to any single invocation of the processor, so all methods (and accessors for readonly properties)
    /// of an image processor kernel class are class methods.
    ///
    /// Your subclass should override at least the ``processWithInputs:arguments:output:error:`` method to perform its
    /// image processing.
    ///
    /// If your image processor needs to work with a larger or smaller region of interest in the input image than each
    /// corresponding region of the output image (for example, a blur filter, which samples several input pixels for
    /// each output pixel), you should also override the ``roiForInput:arguments:outputRect:`` method.
    ///
    /// You can also override the formatForInputAtIndex: method and outputFormat property getter to customize the input
    /// and output pixel formats for your processor (for example, as part of a multi-step workflow where you extract a
    /// single channel from an RGBA image, apply an effect to that channel only, then recombine the channels).
    ///
    /// ## Using a Custom Image Processor
    ///
    /// To apply your custom image processor class to create a ``CIImage`` object, call the
    /// ``applyWithExtent:inputs:arguments:error:`` class method. (Do not override this method.)
    ///
