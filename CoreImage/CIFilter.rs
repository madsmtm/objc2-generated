extern_class!(
    /// An image processor that produces an image by manipulating one or more input images or by generating new image data.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The `CIFilter` class produces a [`CIImage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/ciimage) object as output. Typically, a filter takes one or more images as input. Some filters, however, generate an image based on other types of input parameters. The par`CIFilter` swift.class` object are set and retrieved through the use of key-value pairs.
    ///
    /// You use the `CIFilter` object in conjunction with other Core Image classes, such as  `CIImage`, [`CIContext`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cicontext), and [`CIColor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cicolor), to take advantage of the built-in Core Image filters when processing images, creating filter generators, or writing custom filters.
    ///
    /// `CIFilter` objects are mutable, and thus cannot be shared safely among threads. Each thread must create its own `CIFilter` objects, but you can pass a filter’s immutable input and output `CIImage` objects between threads.
    ///
    /// To get a quick overview of how to set up and use Core Image filters, see [Core Image Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/CoreImaging/ci_intro/ci_intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001185).
    ///
    /// ### Create type-safe filters
    ///
    /// Core Image provides methods that create type-safe `CIFilter` instances. Use these filters to avoid run-time errors that can occur when relying on Core Image’s string-based API.
    ///
    /// To use the type-safe API, import `CoreImage.CIFilterBuiltins`:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// #import <CoreImage/CoreImage.h>
    /// #import <CoreImage/CIFilterBuiltins.h>
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The type-safe approach returns a non-optional filter. Because the returned filter conforms to the relevant protocol—for example, [`CIFalseColor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifalsecolor) in the case of [`falseColorFilter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifilter-swift.class/falsecolor())—the parameters are available as properties. The following creates and applies a false color filter:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// - (CIImage *) falseColorImage:(CIImage*) inputImage {
    ///     CIFilter<CIFalseColor> *falseColorFilter = CIFilter.falseColorFilter;
    ///     falseColorFilter.color0 = [CIColor colorWithRed:1 green:1 blue:0];
    ///     falseColorFilter.color1 = [CIColor colorWithRed:0 green:0 blue:1];
    ///     falseColorFilter.inputImage = inputImage;
    ///     return falseColorFilter.outputImage;
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The false color filter maps luminance to a color ramp of two colors:
    ///
    ///
    /// ![Two photographs showing a flower. The image on the left shows the original version of the flower. The image on the right shows the false color version of the flower.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/31bc2cc68e11100dbfd10afe19552daa/media-4336877%402x.png)
    ///
    ///
    /// ### Subclassing notes
    ///
    /// You can subclass `CIFilter` in order to create custom filter effects:
    ///
    /// - By chaining together two or more built-in Core Image filters
    ///
    /// - By using an image-processing kernel that you write
    ///
    /// Regardless of whether your subclass provides its effect by chaining filters or implementing its own kernel, you should:
    ///
    /// - Declare any input parameters as properties whose names are prefixed with `input`, such as `inputImage`.
    ///
    /// - Override the [`setDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifilter-swift.class/setdefaults()) methods to provide default values for any input parameters you’ve declared.
    ///
    /// - Implement an `outputImage` method to create a new `CIImage` with your filter’s effect.
    ///
    /// The `CIFilter` class automatically manages input parameters when archiving, copying, and deallocating filters. For this reason, your subclass must obey the following guidelines to ensure proper behavior:
    ///
    /// - Store input parameters in instance variables whose names are prefixed with `input`.
    ///
    /// Don’t use auto-synthesized instance variables, because their names are automatically prefixed with an underscore. Instead, synthesize the property manually. For example:
    ///
    /// `@synthesize inputMyParameter;`
    ///
    /// - If using manual reference counting, don’t release input parameter instance variables in your [`dealloc`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1571947-dealloc) method implementation. The [`dealloc`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1571947-dealloc) implementation in the `CIFilter` class uses [Key-value coding](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/KeyValueCoding.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008195-CH25) to automatically set the values of all input parameters to `nil`.

    ///
    /// CIFilter are filter objects for Core Image that encapsulate the filter with its attributes
    ///
    /// The CIFilter class produces a CIImage object as output. Typically, a filter takes one or more images as input. Some filters, however, generate an image based on other types of input parameters. The parameters of a CIFilter object are set and retrieved through the use of key-value pairs. You use the CIFilter object in conjunction with the CIImage, CIContext, CIVector, CIImageAccumulator, and CIColor objects to take advantage of the built-in Core Image filters when processing images. CIFilter objects are also used along with CIKernel, CISampler, and CIFilterShape objects to create custom filters.
