/// whether the application owns the privileged tool once installed (i.e. in
/// order for subsequent versions to update the installed version).
///
/// Each key of SMPrivilegedExecutables is a reverse-DNS label for the helper
/// tool (must be globally unique).
///
/// 3.    The helper tool must have an embedded Info.plist containing an
/// "SMAuthorizedClients" array of strings. Each string is a textual
/// representation of a code signing requirement describing a client which
/// is allowed to add and remove the tool.
///
/// 4.    The helper tool must have an embedded launchd plist. The only required
/// key in this plist is the Label key. When the launchd plist is extracted
/// and written to disk, the key for ProgramArguments will be set to an
/// array of 1 element pointing to a standard location. You cannot specify
/// your own Program or ProgramArguments, so do not rely on custom command
/// line arguments being passed to your tool. Pass any parameters via IPC.
/// This plist must be embedded in the __TEXT,__launchd_plist section of the
/// binary.
///
/// A property list may be embedded in an executable at link-time with the
/// -sectcreate linker flag.
///
/// 5.    The helper tool must reside in the Contents/Library/LaunchServices
/// directory inside the application bundle, and its name must be its
/// launchd job label. So if your launchd job label is
/// "com.apple.Mail.helper", this must be the name of the tool in your
/// application bundle.
///
///
/// Parameter `domain`: The job's domain. Passing any value other than {
///
/// ```text
///  kSMDomainSystemLaunchd}
///  will result in undefined behavior.
///
///  @param executableLabel
///  The label of the privileged executable to install. This label must be one of
///  the keys found in the SMPrivilegedExecutables dictionary in the application's
///  Info.plist.
///
///  @param auth
///  An authorization reference containing the
///  {@link kSMRightBlessPrivilegedHelper} right.
///
