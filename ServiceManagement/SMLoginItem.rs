/// Enables a helper executable in the main app-bundle directory.
///
/// Parameters:
/// - identifier: The identifier of the helper executable bundle.
///
/// - enabled: A Boolean value that represents the state of the helper executable. This value is effective only for the currently logged-in user. If [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), the helper tool executable immediately (and upon subsequent logins) and keeps running. If [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), the helper executable stops.
///
///
/// ## Return Value
///
/// Returns [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) if the requested change has taken effect.
///
///
///
/// ## Discussion
///
/// <div class="warning">
///
/// ### Important
///  To enable or disable `LoginItems` in macOS 13 and later, use the [`registerAndReturnError:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/smappservice/register()) and [`unregisterAndReturnError:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/smappservice/unregister()) methods instead.

/// The build system places helper executables in the app’s bundle in the `Contents/Library/LoginItems` directory.
///
///
/// Enable a helper application located in the main application bundle's
/// Contents/Library/LoginItems directory.
///
/// This API has been deprecated. Please use SMAppService to enable SMLoginItems
///
///
/// Parameter `identifier`: The bundle identifier of the helper application bundle.
///
///
/// Parameter `enabled`: The Boolean enabled state of the helper application. This value is effective
/// only for the currently logged in user. If true, the helper application will
/// be started immediately (and upon subsequent logins) and kept running. If
/// false, the helper application will no longer be kept running.
///
///
/// Returns: Returns true if the requested change has taken effect.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// `identifier` might not allow `None`.
