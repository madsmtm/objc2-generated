/// An instance that optimizes memory allocation when working with large blocks of memory.
/// CMMemoryPool.h
///
/// Memory pool for optimizing repeated large block allocation.
///
/// CMMemoryPool is a memory allocation service that holds onto a pool of
/// recently deallocated memory so as to speed up subsequent allocations of the same size.
/// It's intended for cases where large memory blocks need to be repeatedly allocated --
/// for example, the compressed data output by a video encoder.
///
/// All of its allocations are on the granularity of page sizes; it does not suballocate
/// memory within pages, so it is a poor choice for allocating tiny blocks.
/// For example, it's appropriate to use as the blockAllocator argument to
/// CMBlockBufferCreateWithMemoryBlock, but not the structureAllocator argument --
/// use kCFAllocatorDefault instead.
///
/// When you no longer need to allocate memory from the pool, call CMMemoryPoolInvalidate
/// and CFRelease.  Calling CMMemoryPoolInvalidate tells the pool to stop holding onto
/// memory for reuse.  Note that the pool's CFAllocator can outlive the pool, owing
/// to the way that CoreFoundation is designed: CFAllocators are themselves CF objects,
/// and every object allocated with a CFAllocator implicitly retains the CFAllocator
/// until it is finalized.  After the CMMemoryPool is invalidated or finalized,
/// its CFAllocator allocates and deallocates with no pooling behavior.
///
/// CMMemoryPool deallocates memory if it has not been recycled in 0.5 second,
/// so that short-term peak usage does not cause persistent bloat.
/// (This period may be overridden by specifying kCMMemoryPoolOption_AgeOutPeriod.)
/// Such "aging out" is done during the pool's CFAllocatorAllocate and
/// CFAllocatorDeallocate methods.
