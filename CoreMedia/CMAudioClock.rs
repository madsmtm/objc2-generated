    /// Creates a clock that advances at the same rate as audio output.

    /// - allocator: Allocator for the new clock; pass [`kCFAllocatorDefault`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/kcfallocatordefault) or `nil` to use the default allocator.
    ///
    /// - clockOut: Upon return, a pointer to the newly created clock.

    /// ## Discussion
    ///
    /// This clock doesn’t drift from audio output, but may drift from [`CMClockGetHostTimeClock`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremedia/cmclockgethosttimeclock()). When audio output is completely stopped, the clock continues to advance, tracking `CMClockGetHostTimeClock` until audio output starts up again.

    /// ### Important
    ///  In Objective-C, you’re responsible for calling [`CFRelease`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/1521153-cfrelease) to release the returned `clockOut`.
    ///
    ///
    ///
    /// </div>
    /// You can use this clock as the [`sourceClock`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayer/sourceclock) of an [`AVPlayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayer) instance when synchronizing video-only playback with audio played through other APIs or objects.
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Note
    ///  For Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst, use [`CMAudioDeviceClockCreate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremedia/cmaudiodeviceclockcreate(allocator:deviceuid:clockout:)) or [`CMAudioDeviceClockCreateFromAudioDeviceID`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremedia/cmaudiodeviceclockcreatefromaudiodeviceid(allocator:deviceid:clockout:)) to target a specific, nondefault audio device.
