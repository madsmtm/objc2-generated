    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// A Message Filter app extension that adopts this protocol forms a response about the message described in the query, based on information that it either stores locally or receives from an associated network service.
    ///
    /// When the app extension defers a query request to a server, the system handles all network communication, passing the request to the server and passing the server’s response back to the app extension.
    ///
    ///
    /// Functionality related to MessageFilter extension query requests.
    ///
    /// Subclasses of ILMessageFilterExtension which support querying must conform to this protocol.
