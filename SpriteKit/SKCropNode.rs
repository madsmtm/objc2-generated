    /// A node that masks pixels drawn by its children so that only some pixels are seen.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// `SKCropNode` is a container node that you use to crop other nodes in the scene. You add other nodes to a crop node and set the crop node’s [`maskNode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skcropnode/masknode) property. For example, here are some ways you might specify a mask:
    ///
    /// - An untextured sprite that limits content to a rectangular portion of the scene.
    ///
    /// - A textured sprite that works as a precise per-pixel mask.
    ///
    /// - A collection of child nodes that form a unique shape.
    ///
    /// You can animate the shape or contents of the mask to implement interesting effects such as hiding or revealing.
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Tip
    ///  Use crop nodes sparingly. Because they require an additional offscreen memory buffer to perform the crop and add a rendering operation into the offscreen buffer, they add notably more overhead to the app.
    ///
    ///
    ///
    /// </div>

    /// A SpriteKit node that masks child nodes using another node's alpha component
