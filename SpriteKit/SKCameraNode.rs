    /// It also uses the standard SKNode transform system so modifying the camera node's position
    /// is how you translate the camera's viewport. Applying a scale to the node would zoom
    /// the viewport in or out etc. As an added benefit you can now rotate the viewport by
    /// applying a zRotation to the camera node, just as you would with any other SKNode.
    ///
    /// The camera viewport is centered on the camera's position. It uses the scene's frame
    /// and scale mode along with the node transforms to determine the size, origin and
    /// rotation of the viewport.

    /// There are some convenience functions included for testing if nodes are contained
    /// within the camera viewport. It can be used to determine if objects are no longer
    /// visible on the display.
