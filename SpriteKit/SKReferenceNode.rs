    /// A node that’s defined in an archived `.sks` file.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// `SKReferenceNode` is used within an archived `.sks` file to refer to node defined in another `.sks` file without duplicating its definition. This way, a change to the referenced node propagates to all the references in other files.
    ///
    /// <div class="warning">
    ///
    /// ### Note
    ///  `SKReferenceNode` is mostly used in conjunction with Xcode’s SpriteKit Scene editor, but it’s possible to instantiate it yourself and use the [`resolveReferenceNode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skreferencenode/resolve()) function as a handy way to restore a node’s appearance.
    ///
    ///
    ///
    /// </div>
    /// As an example, you might want to share an enemy ship across two different levels, Scene1.sks and Scene2.sks, in a level-based game. Reference nodes allow you to do that without creating copies of the shared node and its properties.
    ///
    /// To use a reference node:
    ///
    /// - Create the shared content in a separate archive
    ///
    /// - Add references to the shared archive within your scene archives
    ///
    /// When each scene is loaded, the reference nodes are resolved dynamically, and therefore you only need to configure a shared object in one place.
    ///
