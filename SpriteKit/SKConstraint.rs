    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// An [`SKConstraint`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skconstraint) object describes a mathematical constraint on a node’s position or orientation. You attach constraints to nodes; after a scene processes any actions and physics interactions, it applies constraints attached to nodes in its node tree. Use constraints to ensure that certain relationships are true before the system renders a scene. For example, you might use a constraint to:
    ///
    /// - Change a node’s [`zRotation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/sknode/zrotation) property so that it always points at another node or a position in the scene.
    ///
    /// - Keep a node within a specified distance of another node or a point in the scene.
    ///
    /// - Keep a node inside a specified rectangle.
    ///
    /// - Restrict the [`zRotation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/sknode/zrotation) property of a node so that it has a more limited rotation range of motion.
    ///
    /// To use constraints, create an [`NSArray`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsarray) object that contains one or more constraint objects and assign the array to a node’s [`constraints`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/sknode/constraints) property. When the system evaluates a scene, it executes the constraints on a node in the order they appear in the [`constraints`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/sknode/constraints) array.
    ///
    /// You can’t change a constraint after you create it. However, you can selectively disable or enable a constraint by setting its [`enabled`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skconstraint/enabled) property. You can also use the [`referenceNode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skconstraint/referencenode) property to convert positions to the referenced coordinate system before applying the constraint.
    ///
    ///
    /// SKConstraints are evaluated each frame after actions and physics.
    /// The node's transform will be changed to staisfy the constarint
