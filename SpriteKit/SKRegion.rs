    /// An [`SKRegion`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skregion) object defines a mathematical shape and is typically used to determine whether a particular point lies inside this area. For example, regions are used to define the area that a physics field can affect. Regions are defined using paths and mathematical shapes and can also be combined using constructive solid geometry.
