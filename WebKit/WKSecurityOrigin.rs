    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// A [`WKSecurityOrigin`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wksecurityorigin) object is a transient, data-only object that identifies the host name, protocol, and port number associated with a particular resource. You don’t create [`WKSecurityOrigin`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wksecurityorigin) objects directly. Instead, WebKit creates them for the resources it loads. A _first-party_ load is any load URL has the same security origin as the requesting web site. First-party webpages can access each other’s resources, such as scripts and databases.
    ///
    /// Because a [`WKSecurityOrigin`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wksecurityorigin) object is transient, it doesn’t uniquely identify a security origin across multiple delegate method calls.
    ///
    ///
    /// A WKSecurityOrigin object contains information about a security origin.
    ///
    /// An instance of this class is a transient, data-only object;
    /// it does not uniquely identify a security origin across multiple delegate method
    /// calls.
