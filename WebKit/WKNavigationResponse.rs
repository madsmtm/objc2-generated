    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Use a [`WKNavigationResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wknavigationresponse) object to make policy decisions about whether to allow navigation within your app’s web view. You don’t create [`WKNavigationResponse`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wknavigationresponse) objects directly. Instead, the web view creates them and delivers them to the appropriate delegate objects. Use the methods of your delegate to analyze the response and determine whether to allow the resulting navigation to occur.
