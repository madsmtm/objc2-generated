    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// A [`WKNavigation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wknavigation) object uniquely identifies a load request for a webpage. When you ask a web view to load content or navigate to a page, the web view returns a [`WKNavigation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wknavigation) object that identifies your request. As the load operation progresses, the web view reports progress of that operation to various methods of its navigation delegate, passing them the matching [`WKNavigation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wknavigation) object.
    ///

    /// A WKNavigation object can be used for tracking the loading progress of a webpage.
    ///
    /// A navigation is returned from the web view load methods, and is
    /// also passed to the navigation delegate methods, to uniquely identify a webpage
    /// load from start to finish.
