    ///      instanceAccel.instanceBuffer = instanceBuffer;
    ///
    ///      // Similar for transformation matrix buffer

    /// Finally, rebuild the instance acceleration structure:
    ///
    ///
    /// ```text

    /// Refitting and Rebuilding Bottom-Level Acceleration Structures: when a bottom level acceleration
    /// structure is rebuild or refit, its' bounding box may change. Therefore, the instance
    /// acceleration structure also needs to be rebuilt or refit.

    /// Copying and Serializing Instance Acceleration Structures: When an instance acceleration

    /// such as the instance buffer, transformation buffer, etc.
    ///
    /// Performance Guidelines:
    ///
    /// - Use instancing to reduce memory usage: if there are many copies of the same object(s) in
    /// a scene, using instances of the same object can reduce memory usage and acceleration
    /// structure build time. Rebuilding or refitting the top level acceleration structure can
    /// also be much faster than rebuilding a large single level acceleration structure.
    ///
    /// - Consider flattening your instance hierarchy into a single acceleration structure if the
    /// increased memory usage and acceleration structure build time are not a concern.
    /// Intersecting a two level acceleration structure can have a significant performance cost so
    /// only use it when necessary. Which technique to use depends on the scene and use case. For
    /// example, in a rendering application, it may be best to use an instance hierarchy for
    /// interactive scene editing and preview and flattening the instance hierarchy for the final
    /// render. For smaller scenes, it may also be sufficient to refit a flattened acceleration
    /// structure rather than rebuilding an instance hierarchy.
    ///
    /// - If there is only a single object in the scene, intersect its acceleration structure
    /// directly instead of using an instance hierarchy.
    ///
    /// - Consider dividing objects into static and dynamic acceleration structures. If dynamic
    /// objects require the acceleration structure to be rebuilt frequently, create a high quality
    /// static acceleration structure and a lower quality but faster to build dynamic acceleration
    /// structure. These two acceleration structures can then be combined with a two level
    /// acceleration structure. Use MPSTransformTypeIdentity to reduce the overhead of this
    /// technique. Whether this technique is more efficient than rebuilding the entire
    /// acceleration structure depends on the scene.
