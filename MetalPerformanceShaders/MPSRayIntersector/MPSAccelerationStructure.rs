    /// Performance Guidelines:
    ///
    /// - Provide accurate acceleration structure hints: if an acceleration structure does not
    /// require support for refitting, a higher quality construction algorithm can be used.
    /// However, if an acceleration structure must be rebuilt frequently, a lower quality
    /// but higher performance construction algorithm can be used.
    ///
    /// - Consider refitting existing acceleration structures rather than rebuilding them from
    /// scratch. This is typically much faster and can result in a reasonably high quality
    /// tree if the geometry has not been modified dramatically. Refitting can also be pipelined
    /// with other GPU work. If objects have been added to or removed from the scene, it is
    /// typically necessary to rebuild the acceleration structure rather than refit it.
    ///
    /// - Rebuild acceleration structures asynchronously when possible to avoid blocking the main
    /// thread. Consider presenting a UI indicating that work is happening in the background while
    /// allowing the user to consider interacting with your application.
    ///
    /// - If you need to mix intersection testing with acceleration structure builds (e.g. if the
    /// user is interactively editing the scene while rendering or if objects are moving
    /// significantly) consider allocating two independent acceleration structures that refer to
    /// two copies of the scene data. Then, asynchronously rebuild one acceleration structure
    /// while the other one is used for rendering. Once the rebuild has completed, swap the
    /// acceleration structures. The intermediate frames could be filled by refitting the
    /// rendering acceleration structure until the rebuilt acceleration structure is ready.
    ///
    /// - When running in Xcode, disable "Enable Backtrace Recording" in your scheme settings.
    /// Enabling this setting can significantly increase acceleration structure build time.
    ///
    /// - Consider using quadrilaterals instead of triangles to represent your geometry.
    /// The cost of intersecting a quadrilateral is typically less than the cost of intersecting
    /// two triangles, so quadrilaterals can improve performance. Quadrilaterals also typically
    /// require 30-40% less memory than triangles including vertex data and internal buffers
    /// allocated by the acceleration structure. Whether quadrilaterals improve or hurt
    /// performance can depend on the geometry and ray distribution, so you should choose
    /// whichever performs better for your application.
    ///
    /// Thread Safety: MPSAccelerationStructures are generally not thread safe. Changing properties
    /// and rebuilding acceleration structures from multiple threads result in undefined behavior.
    /// However, it is safe to encode intersection tests with a single acceleration structure
    /// from multiple threads as long as each thread uses its own MPSRayIntersector.
