    /// A MPSImage can be container of multiple CNN images for batch processing. In order to create a
    /// MPSImage that contains N images, create MPSImageDescriptor with numberOfImages set to N.
    ///
    /// Although a MPSImage can contain numberOfImages > 1, the actual number of images among these processed by MPSCNNKernel

    /// clipRect.origin.z. The MPSCNNKernel takes n=clipRect.size.depth images from tje source at indices [offset.z, offset.z+n],

    /// = [src numberOfImage] and clipRect.origin.z+n should be
    /// <
    /// = [dest numberOfImages] and
    /// offset.z must be >= 0.

    /// Example: Suppose MPSCNNConvolution takes an input image with 8 channels and outputs an image with 16 channels. The number of
    /// slices needed in the source 2d texture array is 2 and the number of slices needed in the destination 2d array is 4. Suppose
    /// the source batch size is 5 and destination batch size is 4. (Multiple N-channel images can be processed concurrently in a
    /// batch.) The number of source slices will be 2*5=10 and number of destination slices will be 4*4=16. If you want to process
    /// just images 2 and 3 of the source and store the result at index 1 and 2 in the destination, you may achieve this by setting
    /// offset.z=2, clipRect.origin.z=1 and clipRect.size.depth=2. MPSCNNConvolution will take, in this case, slice 4 and 5 of source and
    /// produce slices 4 to 7 of destination. Similarly, slices 6 and 7 will be used to produce slices 8 to 11 of destination.
    ///
    /// All MPSCNNKernels process images within each batch independently. That is, calling a MPSCNNKernel on an
    /// batch is formally the same as calling it on each image in the batch one at a time. However, quite a lot of CPU and GPU overhead
    /// will be avoided if batch processing is used. This is especially important for better performance on small images.
    ///
    /// If the number of feature channels is
    /// <
    /// = 4 and numberOfImages = 1 i.e. only one slice is needed to represent a MPSImage, the underlying
    /// metal texture type will be MTLTextureType2D rather than MTLTextureType2DArray.
    ///
    /// There are also MPSTemporaryImages, intended for use for very short-lived image data that are produced and consumed
    /// immediately in the same MTLCommandBuffer. They are a useful way to minimize CPU-side texture allocation costs and

    /// Welcome to the 1970's! We have added a heap.
    ///
    /// Unsurprisingly, MPSTemporaryImages can provide for profound reduction in
    /// the the amount of memory used by your application.  Like malloc, MPS
    /// maintains a heap of memory usable in a command buffer. Over the lifetime
    /// of a command buffer, the same piece of memory may be reused many times.
    /// This means that each time the same memory is reused, it aliases with previous

    /// memory only to discover it doesn't contain what you thought it did anymore,
    /// so you should be able to keep out of trouble by following a few simple rules,
    /// like with malloc.
    ///
    /// To this end, we added some restrictions to help you out and get a bit more
    /// performance. Some comments are appended in parentheses below to extend the
    /// analogy of command buffer = program:
    ///
    /// - The textures are MTLStorageModePrivate. You can not, for example, use
    /// [MTLTexture getBytes...] or [MTLTexture replaceRegion...] with them.
    /// MPSTemporaryImages are strictly read and written by the GPU. (There is
    /// protected memory to prevent other processes from overwriting your heap.)
    ///
    /// - The temporary image may be used only on a single MTLCommandBuffer.
    /// This limits the chronology to a single linear time stream. (The heap
    /// is specific to just one command buffer. There are no mutexes to
    /// coordinate timing of simultaneous access by multiple GPUs. Nor are we
    /// likely to like them if there were. So, we disallow it.)
    ///
    /// - The readCount property must be managed correctly. Please see
    /// the description of the readCount property for full details. (The readCount
    /// is a reference count for the block of memory that holds your data. The
    /// usual undefined behaviors apply to reading data that has been released.
    /// We assert when we can to prevent that from happening accidentally,
    /// just as a program might segfault. The readCount counts procedural users
    /// of the object -- MPSKernel.encode... calls that read the MPSTemporaryImage.
    /// As each reads from it, the readCount is automatically decremented. The
    /// texture data will be freed in typical usage at the right time as the
    /// readCount reaches zero, typically with little user involvement other
    /// than to set the readCount up front. We did examine using the main MPSTemporaryImage
    /// reference count for this instead so that ARC would do work for you automatically.
    /// Alas, ARC destroys things at end of scope rather than promptly, sometimes resulting
    /// in greatly increased memory usage. These allocations are large! So, we
    /// use this method instead.)
    ///
    /// Since MPSTemporaryImages can only be used with a single MTLCommandBuffer,
    /// and can not be used off the GPU, they generally should not be kept
    /// around past the completion of the MTLCommandBuffer. The lifetime of
    /// MPSTemporaryImages is expected to be typically extremely short, perhaps
    /// only a few lines of code. Like malloc, it is intended to be fairly cheap
    /// to make MPSTemporaryImages and throw them away. Please do so.
    ///
    /// To keep the lifetime of the underlying texture allocation as short as
    /// possible, the underlying texture is not allocated until the first time
    /// the MPSTemporaryImage is used by a MPSCNNKernel or the .texture property
    /// is read. The readCount property serves to limit the lifetime on the
    /// other end.
    ///
    /// You may use the MPSTemporaryImage.texture with MPSUnaryImageKernel -encode... methods,
    /// iff featureChannels
    /// <
    /// = 4 and the MTLTexture conforms to requirements of that MPSKernel.
    /// There is no locking mechanism provided to prevent a MTLTexture returned
    /// from the .texture property from becoming invalid when the readCount reaches 0.
    ///
    /// Finally, MPSTemporaryImages are complicated to use with blit encoders.
    /// Your application should assume that the MPSTemporaryImage is backed by a MTLHeap,
    /// and consequently needs a MTLFence to ensure that compute command encoders and other
    /// encoders do not trip over one another with heap based memory. MPS will almost never
    /// use a blit encoder for this reason. If you do need one, then you will need to make
    /// a new compute encoder to block on whatever previous compute encoder last used the
    /// heap block. (MPS will not tell you who previously used the heap block. That encoder
    /// is almost certainly long dead anyway.) If concurrent encoders are involved, then a
    /// barrier might be needed. Within that compute encoder, you will call -updateFence.
    /// End the compute encoder, make a blit encoder wait for the fence, do the blit, update
    /// a new fence, then make a new compute encoder, wait for the second fence, then you
    /// can continue. Possibly the second do-nothing compute encoder needs to be ended so
    /// MPS can be called. Frankly, we don't bother with blit encoders and just write a compute
    /// operation for copy / clear as needed, or better yet find a way to eliminate the
    /// clear / copy pass so we don't have to pay for it. Note: the most common use of a
    /// blit encoder, -synchronizeResource: can not encounter this problem because
