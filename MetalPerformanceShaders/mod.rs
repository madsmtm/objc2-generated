    /// Hint to MPS how much memory your application expects to need for the command buffer
    ///
    /// This will cause MPS to prefetch a MTLHeap into its internal cache of
    /// the indicated size, which will be sub-allocated to back the temporary images,
    /// matrices, vectors and states in used over the course of the command buffer.
    /// This can be helpful in certain pathological situations when allocation sizes
    /// needed to support temporary objects do not allow for reuse of previous allocations
    /// for new objects.
    ///
    /// Example: if the temporary resources need progressively larger MTLHeaps
    /// over the course of the MTLCommandBuffer, such as 1 MB, 2MB, 4 MB and 8MB,
    /// the first allocation might create a 1 MB heap, this might be released,
    /// but since the second allocation needs a 2 MB heap and the 1 MB heap is too
    /// small to be used, a new heap would need to be made, and so forth.  Using
    /// MPSHintTemporaryMemoryHighWaterMark(), a single 8 MB heap might be made manifest,
    /// and all four allocations can use it if they don't overlap temporally. Otherwise,
    /// a total of 1+2+4+8=15 MB might be allocated.
    ///
    /// The application should be careful not to pass the sum of all allocations over
    /// the course of the command buffer. As we expect that not all temporary resources
    /// need to coexist at the same time, and so can alias one another, that would waste
    /// memory. The application should instead track the high water mark of the most
    /// memory in use at any single point over the course of the command buffer.
    ///
    /// This can be simply done by traversing your graph creating all the temporary images,
    /// states, matrices and vectors that you will need in advance. Since the allocation of
    /// the underlying MTLHeaps that they use is deferred until you actually attempt to write
    /// to these resources or get the underlying MTLTexture or MTLBuffer, you can create all
    /// the objects, then call MPSHintTemporaryMemoryUsage, then call the various -encode
    /// methods and the heap should be sized correctly before memory is distributed to the
    /// temporary objects. In this exercise, assume that memory is not distributed to the
    /// temporary object until it is used to hold data, and is reclaimed for reuse when readCount
    /// reaches zero. The expected size temporary memory used by each object can be queried
    /// using its -resourceSize method.
    ///
    /// Notes: The MPSNNGraph does this automatically for its workload. It is not necessary to
    /// prefetch for that. If a MTLHeap large enough to satisfy the size is already cached,
    /// no new one will be created. If the prefetched heap turns out to be too small, additional
    /// small heaps will be created as needed dynamically. If the prefetched heap is too big,
    /// any additional memory is wasted.
    ///
    /// When the graph is known in advance, this method is preferred over
    /// +[MPSTemporaryImage prefetchStorageWithCommandBuffer:imageDescriptorList:]
    /// as the latter can not estimate the time period over which each resource is used, and is
    /// likely to conservatively prefetch too small a heap.
