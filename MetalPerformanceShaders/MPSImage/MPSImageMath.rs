    /// This filter takes two source images, a primary source image and a secondary source image,
    /// and outputs a single destination image. It applies an element-wise arithmetic operator to
    /// each pixel in a primary source image and a corresponding pixel in a secondary source image
    /// over a specified region.
    ///
    /// The supported arithmetic operators are the following:
    /// - Addition
    /// - Subtraction
    /// - Multiplication
    /// - Division
    ///
    /// This filter takes additional parameters: primaryScale, secondaryScale, and bias. The default
    /// value for primaryScale and secondaryScale is 1.0f. The default value for bias is 0.0f. This
    /// filter applies primaryScale, secondaryScale, and bias to the primary source pixel (x) and
    /// secondary source pixel (y) in the following way:
    /// - Addition:         result = ((primaryScale * x) + (secondaryScale * y)) + bias
    /// - Subtraction:      result = ((primaryScale * x) - (secondaryScale * y)) + bias
    /// - Multiplicaton:    result = ((primaryScale * x) * (secondaryScale * y)) + bias
    /// - Division:         result = ((primaryScale * x) / (secondaryScale * y)) + bias
    ///
    /// To clamp the result of an arithmetic operation, where
    /// result = clamp(result, minimumValue, maximumValue),
    /// set the minimumValue and maximumValue appropriately. The default value of minimumValue
    /// is -FLT_MAX. The default value of maximumValue is FLT_MAX.
    ///
    /// This filter also takes the following additional parameters:
    /// - primaryStrideInPixels
    /// - secondaryStrideInPixels
    /// These parameters can be used to control broadcasting for the data stored in the primary and
    /// secondary source images. For example, setting all strides for the primary source image to 0
    /// will result in the primarySource image being treated as a scalar value. The only supported
    /// values are 0 or 1. The default value of these parameters is 1.
    ///
    /// This filter accepts uint and int data in addition to unorm and floating-point data.
    ///
    /// You must use one of the sub-classes of MPSImageArithmetic.
