    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// The system creates instances of this class to handle active passkey requests, and passes them to your extension by calling [`prepareCredentialListForServiceIdentifiers:requestParameters:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/ascredentialproviderviewcontroller/preparecredentiallist(for:requestparameters:)). Use the properties of the given request parameters object, along with the passkey credential that the person chooses, to construct a passkey credential response that you return to the system using [`completeAssertionRequestWithSelectedPasskeyCredential:completionHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/ascredentialproviderextensioncontext/completeassertionrequest(using:completionhandler:)).

    /// -[ASCredentialProviderViewController prepareCredentialListForServiceIdentifiers:requestParameters:] and should be used
    /// to construct a passkey credential response using the item selected by the user from the extension's UI.
