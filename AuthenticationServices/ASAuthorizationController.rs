    /// Create authorization requests for the credential types your app supports, such as [`ASAuthorizationAppleIDRequest`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationappleidrequest) for Sign in with Apple, or [`ASAuthorizationPasswordRequest`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationpasswordrequest) for password credentials. Create an authorization controller using [`initWithAuthorizationRequests:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationcontroller/init(authorizationrequests:)), supplying the authorization requests you create. Set the authorization controller’s [`delegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationcontroller/delegate) to receive responses when requests succeed or fail, and set its [`presentationContextProvider`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationcontroller/presentationcontextprovider) so that the authorization controller can present UI.
    ///
    /// Call [`performAutoFillAssistedRequests`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationcontroller/performautofillassistedrequests()) to present inline UI to request credentials, or [`performRequests`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationcontroller/performrequests()) or [`performRequestsWithOptions:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationcontroller/performrequests(options:)) to request credentials using modal UI. [`ASAuthorizationController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationcontroller) calls your delegate’s methods when the request completes.
    ///
    /// Set the content type of text fields in your app’s login UI so that [`ASAuthorizationController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationcontroller) can detect when to offer AutoFill suggestions. Use [`UITextContentTypeUsername`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextcontenttype/username) as the content type for user name text fields, and [`UITextContentTypePassword`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextcontenttype/password) for password fields.
