/// Use one or more of these values in the [`requestedScopes`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationopenidrequest/requestedscopes) array that you configure in an instance of either [`ASAuthorizationAppleIDRequest`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationappleidrequest) or [`ASAuthorizationSingleSignOnRequest`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationsinglesignonrequest) to request certain contact information from the user.
///
/// Inspect the [`authorizedScopes`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationappleidcredential/authorizedscopes) array of an [`ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationappleidcredential) instance, or the (similarly named) [`authorizedScopes`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationsinglesignoncredential/authorizedscopes) array of an [`ASAuthorizationSingleSignOnCredential`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationsinglesignoncredential) instance, to see what scopes the user actually authorized. This might differ from the scopes you requested.
