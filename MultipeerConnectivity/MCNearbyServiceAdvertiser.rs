    /// The `MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser` class publishes an advertisement for a specific service that your app provides through the Multipeer Connectivity framework and notifies its delegate about invitations from nearby peers.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Before you can advertise a service, you must create an `MCPeerID` object that identifies your app and the user to nearby devices.
    ///
    /// The `serviceType` parameter is a short text string used to describe the app’s networking protocol.  It should be in the same format as a Bonjour service type: 1–15 characters long and valid characters include ASCII lowercase letters, numbers, and the hyphen, containing at least one letter and no adjacent hyphens.  A short name that distinguishes itself from unrelated services is recommended; for example, a text chat app made by ABC company could use the service type `"abc-txtchat"`. For more information about service types, read [Domain Naming Conventions](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/NetServices/Articles/domainnames.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002460).
    ///
    /// The `discoveryInfo` parameter is a dictionary of string key/value pairs that will be advertised for browsers to see.  The content of `discoveryInfo` will be advertised within Bonjour TXT records, so you should keep the dictionary small for better discovery performance.
    ///
    /// For more information about TXT records, read [Bonjour Operations](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/NetServices/Articles/NetServicesArchitecture.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001074).
