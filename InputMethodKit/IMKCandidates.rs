The `IMKCandidates` class supports using a candidates window  in your input method; using `IMKCandidates` is optional. Not all input methods require them.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// When you create an `IMKCandidates` object, you attach it to the `IMKServer` object for your input method.  You then need to override the `IMKInputController` methods `candidateSelectionChanged:` and `candidateSelected:` as well as implement a candidates method in your delegate object.  The `IMKInputController` subclass supplies candidates to the `IMKCandidates` object by implementing the candidates method. When you are ready to display a candidates window, call the candidates method to update candidates and to show the candidates window.
