    /// A predefined value, kSecAttrSynchronizableAny, may be provided instead of
    /// kCFBooleanTrue if both synchronizable and non-synchronizable results are
    /// desired.
    ///
    /// IMPORTANT: Specifying the kSecAttrSynchronizable key has several caveats:
    ///
    /// - Updating or deleting items using the kSecAttrSynchronizable key will
    /// affect all copies of the item, not just the one on your local device.
    /// Be sure that it makes sense to use the same password on all devices
    /// before deciding to make a password synchronizable.
    /// - Starting in iOS 14, macOS 11, and watchOS 7, the keychain
    /// synchronizes passwords, certificates, and cryptographic keys.
    /// Earlier OS versions synchronize only passwords.
    /// - Items stored or obtained using the kSecAttrSynchronizable key cannot
    /// specify SecAccessRef-based access control with kSecAttrAccess. If a
    /// password is intended to be shared between multiple applications, the
    /// kSecAttrAccessGroup key must be specified, and each application
    /// using this password must have a 'keychain-access-groups' entitlement
    /// with the specified access group value.
    /// - Items stored or obtained using the kSecAttrSynchronizable key may
    /// not also specify a kSecAttrAccessible value which is incompatible
    /// with syncing (namely, those whose names end with "ThisDeviceOnly".)
    /// - On macOS, when kSecAttrSynchronizable is set to true, returning
    /// references is supported only for Certificate, Key or Identity items.
    /// - Persistent references to synchronizable items should be avoided;
    /// while they may work locally, they cannot be moved between devices,
    /// and may not resolve if the item is modified on some other device.
    /// - When specifying a query that uses the kSecAttrSynchronizable key,
    /// search keys are limited to the item's class and attributes.
    /// The only search constant which may be used is kSecMatchLimit; other
    /// constants using the kSecMatch prefix are not supported at this time.
