    /// An object that uniquely identifies media content in either a single piece or a collection.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Every content identifier is represented by two parts: a string identifier ([`identifier`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvservices/tvcontentidentifier/identifier)) and a container identifier ([`container`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvservices/tvcontentidentifier/container)). The container identifier may be `nil`, which indicates that the content lives at the top level of the container hierarchy. You are responsible for organizing your content into a hierarchy and creating identifiers that uniquely identify each piece of content.
    ///
    /// When designing your content identifiers, follow this guidance:
    ///
    /// - A given content identifier must be unique for a particular content item, across _all_ past, current, and future content items, even if the user no longer has access to that item.
    ///
    /// - The uniqueness of a content identifier comes from the uniqueness of its two parts. The [`identifier`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvservices/tvcontentidentifier/identifier) property of a content identifier need not be universally unique across all of the app’s content identifiers, as long as items that share the same identifier string are contained in different containers.
    ///
    ///
    /// Represents unique identifiers for TVContentItems.
    ///
    /// A content identifier is represented by a string, with an optional
    /// hierarchical structure of other content identifiers. A content identifier
    /// should be unique to a particular Content Item, across ALL past, current,
    /// and future content items. A content identifier should be durable: it
    /// should be able to be saved by itself, and an item should be able to be
    /// identified by it, unambiguously, in the future (though the user may not
    /// have access to that item). The uniqueness of a content identifier comes
    /// from the uniqueness of its two parts: its identifier string and its
    /// container (another content identifier). The identifier property of
    /// content identifiers need not be univerally unique across all the app's
    /// content identifiers, if items have container properties which are
    /// themselves unique. However, developers should then be careful to not
    /// be confused by equal identifier strings in content identifiers with
    /// different container hierarchies.
