    /// Use [`TVTopShelfNamedAttribute`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvservices/tvtopshelfnamedattribute) objects to specify additional information about your content, such as the names of cast or crew members associated with a movie or show. Each named attribute contains the type of information you want to include (the name) and a list of strings (the values) to display for that attribute. For example, you might set the name property to “Starring” and set the value strings to the names of the leading actors.
