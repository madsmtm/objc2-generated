Apps that implement this extension can provide dynamic content to the Top Shelf element rather than having the system use the static image submitted with the app. The [`topShelfStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvservices/tvtopshelfprovider/topshelfstyle) property specifies the interface style you want, and the [`topShelfItems`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvservices/tvtopshelfprovider/topshelfitems) property specifies the content items to display. Whenever you change the content provided by the extension, post a [`TVTopShelfItemsDidChangeNotification`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvservices/tvtopshelfitemsdidchangenotification) notification to prompt the system to reload your content.
