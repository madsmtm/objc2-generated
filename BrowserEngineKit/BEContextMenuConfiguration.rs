    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Return an instance of this object if you don’t know whether presentation of a contextual menu is possible, or don’t already have the menu items when the system calls your interaction delegate’s [`contextMenuInteraction:configurationForMenuAtLocation:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicontextmenuinteractiondelegate/contextmenuinteraction(_:configurationformenuatlocation:)) method. As soon as you have the real configuration, call [`fulfillUsingConfiguration:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/browserenginekit/becontextmenuconfiguration/fulfill(using:)), and pass the real configuration as the parameter, or `nil` to indicate no menu presentation is possible.

    /// ### Note
    ///  In most situations, use [`UIDeferredMenuElement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uideferredmenuelement) if you don’t have the content of a contextual menu element when the system asks your delegate and you need to calculate it asynchronously. When calculating the contextual menu configuration involves a short deferral, for example, making an XPC call to a browser extension, use `BEContextMenuConfiguration` instead.
