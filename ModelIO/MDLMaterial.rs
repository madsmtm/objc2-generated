The properties defined by this class, along with some properties inherited from the superclass [`MDLScatteringFunction`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/modelio/mdlscatteringfunction), describe a shading model that more closely simulates real-world lighting physics than traditional shading models. (This shading model is similar to those used in recent game engines and feature films.)

Creating a new scattering function object with the inherited [`init`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject-swift.class/init()) method creates a set of material properties with useful default values for this shading model.
