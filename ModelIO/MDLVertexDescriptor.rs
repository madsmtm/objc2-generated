/// ## Overview
///
/// The values for vertex formats are constructed such that you can use bit masks to infer useful information about a format:
///
/// - The lowest order byte contains the number of vector components in a vertex format. For example, the raw value for the [`MDLVertexFormatChar3`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/modelio/mdlvertexformat/char3) format is the bitwise OR of the 3 (the number of components) with the [`MDLVertexFormatCharBits`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/modelio/mdlvertexformat/charbits) value.
///
/// - Special packed formats such as [`MDLVertexFormatInt1010102Normalized`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/modelio/mdlvertexformat/int1010102normalized) have values less than `0x10000`.
///
/// - For unpacked formats, masking away the lower four bytes leaves information about the data type for scalars or vector components.
///
///
/// Describes the format of a an attribute in a vertex buffer
///
/// Designed to be very similar to MTLVertexDescriptor to ease the
/// translation from one to the other. Values are chosen such that
/// packed types would all be less than 0x1000 and the bottom 5 bits
/// can be used to determine the number of channels/components in the
/// format.

    /// A [`MDLMesh`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/modelio/mdlmesh) object contains arrays of data for separate attributes of each vertex, such as position, color, surface normal vector, or texture coordinates. The vertex data for various attributes can be contained in one or more buffers and may be laid out in various contiguous or interleaved formats. You use a mesh’s [`vertexDescriptor`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/modelio/mdlmesh/vertexdescriptor) property to determine the structure of vertex data for a mesh loaded from an asset file for use in rendering or processing a mesh. You also use vertex descriptors to describe the structure of existing vertex data when creating a new mesh.
