    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// When an app receives an Apple Push Notification service payload, return a [`PTPushResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pushtotalk/ptpushresult) object as part of the delegate method. Use [`pushResultForActiveRemoteParticipant:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pushtotalk/ptpushresult/activeremoteparticipant(_:)) to show the latest participant information in the system user interface. Create a push result with [`leaveChannelPushResult`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pushtotalk/ptpushresult/leavechannel) to remove a user from the channel.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// func incomingPushResult(channelManager: PTChannelManager,
    ///                         channelUUID: UUID,
    ///                         pushPayload: [String: Any]) -> PTPushResult {
    ///     guard let activeSpeaker = pushPayload["activeSpeaker"] as? String else {
    ///         // Report that there's no active speaker, so leave the channel.
    ///         return .leaveChannel
    ///     }
