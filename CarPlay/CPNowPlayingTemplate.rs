The protocol defines methods that CarPlay calls when a user taps these buttons. Use your implementation to provide the appropriate behavior when these events occur. For example, when the user taps the Album-Artist button, you can present a new template that displays the content of the current album, playlist, or podcast.

    /// When enabling your Now Playing template’s Album-Artist and Up Next buttons, you must create an object that implements the [`CPNowPlayingTemplateObserver`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/carplay/cpnowplayingtemplateobserver) protocol and register it as an observer by calling the template’s [`addObserver:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/carplay/cpnowplayingtemplate/add(_:)) method.

    /// To display the Now Playing template, call your interface controller’s [`pushTemplate:animated:completion:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/carplay/cpinterfacecontroller/pushtemplate(_:animated:completion:)) method to push it onto your navigation hierarchy.
