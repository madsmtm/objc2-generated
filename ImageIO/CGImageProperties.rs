///
/// Values of this type define the position of the pixel coordinate origin point (`0,0`) and the directions of the coordinate axes relative to the intended display orientation of the image. Orientation values are commonly found in image metadata, and specifying image orientation correctly can be important both for displaying the image and for certain image processing tasks such as face recognition.
///
/// For example, the pixel data for an image captured by an iOS device camera is encoded in the camera sensor’s native landscape orientation. When the user captures a photo while holding the device in portrait orientation, iOS writes an orientation value of [`kCGImagePropertyOrientationRight`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageio/cgimagepropertyorientation/right) in the resulting image file. Software displaying the image can then, after reading that value from the file’s metadata, apply a 90° clockwise rotation to the image data so that the image appears in the photographer’s intended orientation.
///

/// ![To correct an image with right orientation for display, rotate it 90° clockwise.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/a4de8a358cbf9a76800cc595fceb8892/media-2948298%402x.png)

/// ### Compatibility with UIImageOrientation
///
/// The [`CGImagePropertyOrientation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageio/cgimagepropertyorientation) type covers the same set of orientation names available in from the [`UIImageOrientation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage/orientation) type, but the underlying numeric values of each type do not match. (For example, the “left mirrored” orientation has an underlying value of 5 in [`CGImagePropertyOrientation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageio/cgimagepropertyorientation), but an underlying value of 7 in [`UIImageOrientation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage/orientation).)
