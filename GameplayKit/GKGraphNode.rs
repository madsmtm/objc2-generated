    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// A set of connected nodes form a graph that describes the navigability of a game world. Use graph nodes together with a [`GKGraph`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gkgraph) object (or one of its subclasses) to perform actions that relate to the network of nodes as a whole, such as pathfinding to determine routes through the network.
    ///
    /// This class describes the general features of graph nodes, but does not contain geometry information that relates the graph to a game world. You can construct a graph with this class or any of its subclasses:
    ///
    /// - On its own, the [`GKGraphNode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gkgraphnode) class is useful for worlds such as board games, where the connections between nodes are important but their spatial position has no effect on gameplay.
    ///
    /// - Create [`GKGridGraphNode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gkgridgraphnode) objects (for use with the [`GKGridGraph`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gkgridgraph) class) to model worlds where movement is constrained to a two-dimensional integer grid.
    ///
    /// - Create [`GKGraphNode2D`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gkgraphnode2d) objects to model worlds that allow full freedom of movement in a two-dimensional plane. Use these nodes together with the [`GKObstacleGraph`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gkobstaclegraph) or [`GKMeshGraph`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gkmeshgraph) class to create graphs that route around impassable obstacles.
