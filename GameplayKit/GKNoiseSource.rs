    /// The abstract superclass for procedural noise generators.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Each noise source class generalizes a specific noise generation algorithm that produces a distinct general style of noise. For example, the [`GKPerlinNoiseSource`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gkperlinnoisesource) class generates fractal coherent noise similar to clouds, terrain, and other natural phenomena, and the [`GKCylindersNoiseSource`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gkcylindersnoisesource) class generates a field of concentric cylinders useful for creating wood-grain textures.
    ///
    /// To make use of procedural noise in your app or game:
    ///
    /// - Select the [`GKNoiseSource`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gknoisesource) subclass that generates the style of noise you’d like, and configure its properties to customize the noise generation algorithm.
    ///
    /// - Create a [`GKNoise`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gknoise) object from that noise source. A noise object represents a specific configuration of noise generated by the noise source. You can create multiple noise objects and apply operations that combine or modify them to further customize the style of output. Noise objects are lightweight—creating them and applying operations doesn’t perform expensive noise computation.
    ///
    /// - Create a [`GKNoiseMap`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gknoisemap) object from the noise object. Creating a noise map performs the computation to generate noise and apply any operations you specified with [`GKNoise`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gknoise) objects, resulting in a concrete output: a field of values that you can either sample directly, use with the [`SKTexture`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/sktexture) class to generate texture images, or use with the `SKTileMap` class to generate tile maps.
    ///
    ///
    /// A GKNoiseSource instance is a description of procedural noise in 3D space.  Noise sources generate values
    /// between -1.0 and 1.0, inclusive, for any position in continuous 3D space.
    /// Subclasses represent specific types of noise, each with their own parameters that affect the nature of the noise.
    /// Noise sources are the starting point for generating and using procedural noise.  The 3D noise values may be manipulated and
    /// combined with the GKNoise class.  Portions of this 3D noise can be extracted and utilized via the GKNoiseMap class.
    /// Extracted portions of noise are useful in both 2D and 3D games.  Applications include creating realistic textures,
    /// height maps for 2D and 3D game world terrain, tile maps for 2D games, and intentionally imperfect game object and

    /// In general, _noise_ is randomness across a (one-, two-, three-, or many-dimensional) domain—for example, you can create noise by filling an image with values from a random number generator. Unlike such truly random noise, _coherent noise_ is consistent and smooth: you can always generate the same output from a specific seed value, and small variations across the domain create only small variations in noise values.
