    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// A [`GKEntity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gkentity) object represents an entity in games with Entity-Component architecture. In this design, an _entity_ is a general type for objects relevant to the game. Entities typically define no functionality of their own—instead, you define an entity’s features through composition, by adding _components_ that each handle specific aspects of an entity’s behavior in a general way. Because components ([`GKComponent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gkcomponent) subclasses) are general and reusable, you can add many kinds of entities to a game by combining components in different ways, without needing to design new entity classes.
    ///
    /// For more information on Entity-Component architecture, read [Entities and Components](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/GameplayKit_Guide/EntityComponent.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015172-CH6) in [GameplayKit Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/GameplayKit_Guide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015172).
