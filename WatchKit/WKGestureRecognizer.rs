    /// The base class for all other gesture recognizer classes.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Gesture recognizers simplify the event-handling process by tracking touch events for you and calling your custom code when those events match a specific pattern. Gesture recognizers report the results of their tracking to an action method that you define.
    ///
    /// You do not subclass [`WKGestureRecognizer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkgesturerecognizer) or create instances of it directly. Instead, you add concrete gesture recognizer objects to your Watch app’s storyboard file and connect that gesture recognizer to your custom action method. At runtime, you use the methods of this class to get and set the state of your gesture recognizer. The concrete gesture recognizer classes are as follows:
    ///
    /// - [`WKLongPressGestureRecognizer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wklongpressgesturerecognizer)
    ///
    /// - [`WKPanGestureRecognizer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkpangesturerecognizer)
    ///
    /// - [`WKSwipeGestureRecognizer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkswipegesturerecognizer)
    ///
    /// - [`WKTapGestureRecognizer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wktapgesturerecognizer)
    ///
    /// ### Executing Code in Response to a Gesture
    ///
    /// A gesture recognizer has an associated action method that it calls during the recognition process to report on its progress. You define the action method in your interface controller and connect it to the gesture recognizer in Interface Builder. Action methods must conform to one of the following signatures:
    ///
    /// (TODO tabnav: TabNavigator { tabs: [TabItem { title: "Swift", content: [CodeListing { syntax: Some("swift"), code: ["@IBAction func handleGesture()", "@IBAction func handleGesture(gestureRecognizer : WKGestureRecognizer)"], metadata: None }] }, TabItem { title: "Objective-C", content: [CodeListing { syntax: Some("objc"), code: ["- (IBAction)handleGesture", "- (IBAction)handleGesture:(WKGestureRecognizer*)gestureRecognizer"], metadata: None }] }] })
    /// The gesture recognizer calls your action method whenever the value in the [`state`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkgesturerecognizer/state) property changes in a significant way. All gesture recognizers start out in the [`WKGestureRecognizerStatePossible`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkgesturerecognizerstate/possible) state and move to other states as appropriate based on the type of gesture. Gesture recognizers do not call your action method for every state change. For information about when the action method is called, see the constant descriptions of the [`WKGestureRecognizerState`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkgesturerecognizerstate) type.
    ///
    /// watchOS supports two broad categories of gesture recognizers: continuous gesture recognizers and discrete gesture recognizer.
    ///
    /// #### Continuous Gesture Recognizers
    ///
    ///
    /// ![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/eadbf2c2039e5658266f0bc849dbbbdc/media-2557562%402x.png)
    ///
    ///
    /// Continuous gesture recognizers—for example, pan or long touch recognizers—track the user’s gesture and call the action method multiple times during a single gesture. They typically call the action method once when the gesture begins, one or more times as the gesture progresses, and once when the gesture either ends or is canceled. In your action method, use the gesture recognizer’s [`state`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkgesturerecognizer/state) property to perform appropriate tasks based on the current state. For example:
    ///
    /// - [`WKGestureRecognizerStateBegan`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkgesturerecognizerstate/began). Alter the user interface’s appearance to indicate that a gesture has begun.
    ///
    /// - [`WKGestureRecognizerStateChanged`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkgesturerecognizerstate/changed). Update the user interface based on the current touch location.
    ///
    /// - [`WKGestureRecognizerStateEnded`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkgesturerecognizerstate/ended). Return to the normal user interface appearance, indicating that the gesture has ended. Keep any updates.
    ///
    /// - [`WKGestureRecognizerStateCancelled`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkgesturerecognizerstate/cancelled). Return to the normal user interface appearance, indicating that the gesture has ended. Discard any updates.
    ///
    /// #### Discrete Gesture Recognizers
    ///
    ///
    /// ![](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/cb3692b76f000fb3b3a265280f7fdb70/media-2557566%402x.png)
    ///
    ///
    /// Discrete gesture recognizers—for example, tap or swipe recognizers—only trigger a single event as soon as the gesture is recognized. For example, discrete recognizers call their action method when they enter the [`WKGestureRecognizerStateRecognized`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkgesturerecognizerstate/recognized) state. If they enter the [`WKGestureRecognizerStateFailed`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkgesturerecognizerstate/failed) state, they fail silently.

    ///
    /// You do not create instances of this class programmatically. Instead, add a pan gesture recognizer to your Watch app’s storyboard file, dropping it onto a specific interface object. Touches occurring within the bounds of that interface object are tracked by the gesture recognizer and reported to an action method you define on the parent interface controller. For information on defining your action method and connecting it to your gesture recognizer, see [`WKGestureRecognizer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkgesturerecognizer).

    /// ### State Changes for a Pan Gesture
    ///
    ///

    ///
    ///
    /// A pan gesture recognizer tracks touch events continuously, and therefore has many potential state changes. A pan gesture does not transition to the Began state until after the touch event starts moving. After that, it may transition to the Changed state, to the Ended, state, to the Failed state, or to the Cancelled state. The two most common state transition sequences are as follows:
    ///
    /// - Possible —> Began —> [Changed…] —> Ended
    ///
    /// - Possible —> Began —> [Changed…] —> Failed
    ///
    /// The Changed state is optional and may occur multiple times before the Ended, Failed, or Cancelled state is reached. The gesture recognizer calls its action method at each state transition. For more information on implementing continuous gesture recognizers, see [`WKGestureRecognizer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkgesturerecognizer).
    ///
    /// ### Interface Builder Attributes
    ///
    /// Xcode lets you configure information about your gesture recognizer in your storyboard file. A pan gesture recognizer defines no attributes of its own, but you can configure attributes of the [`WKGestureRecognizer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkgesturerecognizer) parent class. For information about those attributes, see [`WKGestureRecognizer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkgesturerecognizer).
