    /// An object that lets you manage SceneKit content for display in your app.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// To provide content for a [`WKInterfaceSCNScene`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkinterfacescnscene) interface object, assign a [`SCNScene`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scnscene) object to the interface’s [`scene`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkinterfacescnscene/scene) property. For additional methods and properties for working with SceneKit, see the [`SCNSceneRenderer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scnscenerenderer) protocol, which defines functionality common across all platforms.
    ///
    /// Do not subclass or create instances of this class yourself. Instead, drag a SceneKit Scene object from your Object Library and add it to your storyboard. Then define an outlet in your interface controller class and connect it to the SceneKit Scene object. For example, to refer to a scene in your interface, define a property with the following syntax in your interface controller class:
    ///
    /// (TODO tabnav: TabNavigator { tabs: [TabItem { title: "Swift", content: [CodeListing { syntax: Some("swift"), code: ["@IBOutlet weak var sceneInterface: WKInterfaceSCNScene!"], metadata: None }] }, TabItem { title: "Objective-C", content: [CodeListing { syntax: Some("objc"), code: ["@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet WKInterfaceSCNScene* sceneInterface;"], metadata: None }] }] })
    /// During the initialization of your interface controller, WatchKit creates a new instance of this class and assigns it to your outlet. At that point, you can use the object in your outlet to make changes to the SceneKit scene.
    ///
    /// The SceneKit scene in your Watch app must be connected to a [`WKInterfaceSCNScene`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkinterfacescnscene) outlet in your WatchKit extension for the scene to be visible in your watchOS app’s user interface.

    ///
    /// By default, when a watchOS app is running, the system reserves a strip of space across the top of the screen to display the time. The app’s content is only displayed in the area below the time.
    ///
    /// In watchOS 4 and later, SpriteKit and SceneKit scenes can fill the full screen. When full screen mode is enabled, the SpriteKit or SceneKit scene extends up, under the time. The system still displays the time in the upper right corner with a gradient behind it, making it clearly visible against the scene.
    ///
    /// To enable full screen mode, place a SpriteKit or SceneKit scene as the interface controller’s only content. Then, in the interface controller’s Attribute inspector, enable the Full Screen attribute.
