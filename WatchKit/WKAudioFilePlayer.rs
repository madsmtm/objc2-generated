    /// Use a player object to start and stop playback and to control the rate of playback. (The [`WKAudioFileQueuePlayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkaudiofilequeueplayer) subclass extends the basic behavior to support playback of more than one item.)

    /// The value of the player’s presentation-related properties are not valid until the underlying asset is loaded. Use the value of the [`status`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkaudiofileplayer/status) property to determine when it is valid to get the values of other properties. Specifically, wait until the status changes to [`WKAudioFilePlayerStatusReadyToPlay`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkaudiofileplayerstatus/readytoplay) to access relevant properties.

    /// The [`WKAudioFilePlayer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkaudiofileplayer) class is key-value observing compliant for the [`currentItem`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkaudiofileplayer/currentitem), [`status`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkaudiofileplayer/status), and [`rate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkaudiofileplayer/rate) properties.
