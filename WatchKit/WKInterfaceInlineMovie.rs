    /// An interface element that displays a video’s poster image and supports inline playing of the video.
    ///
    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// In watchOS 2.0, you had to display video content using a [`WKInterfaceMovie`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkinterfacemovie) object. This object displayed a poster image for the video, and when the user tapped the poster image, the video was shown in a separate, full-screen, modal view.
    ///
    /// The [`WKInterfaceInlineMovie`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkinterfaceinlinemovie) object also lets you display a poster image for your video; however, when the poster is tapped, this video replaces the poster image and plays in place. You can also create videos that play automatically as soon as the scene is presented.
    ///
    /// Do not subclass or create instances of this class yourself. Instead, define outlets in your interface controller class and connect them to the corresponding objects in your storyboard file. For example, to refer to a movie object in your interface, define a property with the following syntax in your interface controller class:
    ///
    /// (TODO tabnav: TabNavigator { tabs: [TabItem { title: "Swift", content: [CodeListing { syntax: Some("swift"), code: ["@IBOutlet weak var myMovie: WKInterfaceInlineMovie!"], metadata: None }] }, TabItem { title: "Objective-C", content: [CodeListing { syntax: Some("objc"), code: ["@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet WKInterfaceInlineMovie* myMovie;"], metadata: None }] }] })
    /// During the initialization of your interface controller, WatchKit creates any needed inline movie objects and assigns them to their associated outlets. At that point, you can use those objects to make changes to the onscreen content.
    ///
    /// Do not attempt to play audio or video content while gathering heart rate data using Health Kit. If you use this class to play media, WatchKit automatically disables the gathering of heart rate data.
    ///
    /// ### Supported Media Formats
    ///
    /// The following table lists the encoding information to use when creating media files to play on a user’s Apple Watch. For audio and video assets played directly from your app, keep your clips relatively short. Short clips consume less space on disk, use less power, and take less time to download.
    ///
    /// (TODO table: Table { header: "row", extended_data: None, rows: [[[Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Media type" }] }], [Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Recommended encoding" }] }]], [[Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Video assets" }] }], [Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Video codec: H.264 High Profile " }, Image { identifier: "spacer", metadata: None }, Text { text: " Bit rate: 160 kpbs at up to 30 fps " }, Image { identifier: "spacer", metadata: None }, Text { text: " Full screen resolution: 208 x 260 in portrait orientation " }, Image { identifier: "spacer", metadata: None }, Text { text: " 16:9 resolution: 320 x 180 in landscape orientation " }, Image { identifier: "spacer", metadata: None }, Text { text: " Audio bit rate: 32 kpbs stereo" }] }]], [[Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Audio-only assets" }] }], [Paragraph { inline_content: [Text { text: "Bit rate: 32 kbps stereo" }] }]]], alignments: None, metadata: None })

    ///
