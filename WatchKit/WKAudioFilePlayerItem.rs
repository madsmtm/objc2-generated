    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Create a player item for each [`WKAudioFileAsset`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkaudiofileasset) object you want to play and use the player item to observe the state of the audio during playback. You can then associate the player item with an audio queue or player object to control the playback.
    ///
    /// The value of the player item’s presentation-related properties are not valid until the underlying asset is loaded. Use the value of the [`status`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkaudiofileplayeritem/status) property to determine when it is valid to get the values of other properties. Specifically, wait until the status changes to [`WKAudioFilePlayerItemStatusReadyToPlay`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkaudiofileplayeritemstatus/readytoplay) to access relevant properties.
    ///
    /// If you want to play an asset more than once within a queue of items, you must create separate player items for each placement in the queue.
    ///
    ///
    /// WatchKit corollary to AVFoundation AVPlayer class
    ///
    ///
    /// This class provides the functionality of AVPlayer for Watch OS apps. Only file-based assets are allowed.
