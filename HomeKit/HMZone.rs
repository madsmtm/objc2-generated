    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// An [`HMZone`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/homekit/hmzone) instance is an optional grouping of rooms in a home, with names like “upstairs” and “downstairs”. Zones are optional—rooms don’t need to be in a zone. By adding rooms to a zone, the user can give commands to Siri like “Siri, turn on all of the lights downstairs.” A single room can be in multiple zones—for example, “kitchen” might be in both the “downstairs” and “entertainment area” zones.
    ///
    /// You create new zones using the [`addZoneWithName:completionHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/homekit/hmhome/addzone(withname:completionhandler:)) method of [`HMHome`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/homekit/hmhome). A zone can’t span homes—that is, you can’t create a zone that includes rooms from more than one home.
    ///

    /// Used to describe a collection of HMRoom objects

    ///
    /// This class is used to group a collection of rooms.
    /// This allows for association of a set of rooms into a group.
    /// Eg. "Living Room" and "Kitchen" rooms can be grouped together
    /// in the "Downstairs" zone.
