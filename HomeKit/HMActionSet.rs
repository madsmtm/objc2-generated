    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// Action sets can be executed as a result of evaluating a trigger (instances of [`HMTrigger`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/homekit/hmtrigger)) or manually with [`executeActionSet:completionHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/homekit/hmhome/executeactionset(_:completionhandler:)). Actions in an action set are performed in an unspecified order. You create new action sets using the [`addActionSetWithName:completionHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/homekit/hmhome/addactionset(withname:completionhandler:)) method of [`HMHome`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/homekit/hmhome).
