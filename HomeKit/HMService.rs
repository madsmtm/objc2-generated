    /// ## Overview
    ///
    /// An [`HMService`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/homekit/hmservice) instance represents a service provided by an accessory. Accessories have both user-controllable services, like a light, and services that are for the use of the accessory itself, like a firmware update service.
    ///
    /// You don’t create services directly. Instead you find them in the [`services`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/homekit/hmaccessory/services) array of an [`HMAccessory`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/homekit/hmaccessory) instance.
    ///
    /// A single accessory may have more than one user-controllable service. For example, most garage door openers have a service for opening and closing the door, and another service for the light on the garage door opener. These services are what Apple’s Home app labels as “accessories”.
    ///
    /// You inspect or change a service’s [`HMCharacteristic`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/homekit/hmcharacteristic) instances to discover state, or modify behavior.
    ///

    /// This class represents a service provided by an accessory in the home.
